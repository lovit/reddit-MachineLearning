I work very frequently with survival analysis and I wanted therefore to try to implement a standard survival model using Theano's automatic differentiation and gradient descent. The model that I am trying to implement is called the Cox model and here is the wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_model\n\nVery helpfully, they have written there the partial likelihood function, which is what is maximized when estimating the parameters of a Cox model. I am quite new to Theano and as a result am having difficulties implementing this cost function and so I am looking for some guidance. \n\nHere is the code I have written so far. My dataset has 137 records and hence the reason I hard-coded that value. T refers to the tensor module, and W refers to what the wikipedia article calls beta, and status is what wikipedia calls C. The remaining variables are identical to wikipedia's notation.\n\n    def negative_log_likelihood(self, y, status):\n        v = 0\n        for i in xrange(137):\n            if T.eq(status[i], 1):\n                v += T.dot(self.X[i], self.W)\n                u = 0\n                for j in xrange(137):\n                    if T.gt(y[j], y[i]):\n                        u += T.exp(T.dot(self.X[j], self.W))\n                v -= T.log(u)\n\n        return T.sum(-v)\n\nUnfortunately, when I run this code, I am unhappily met with an infinite recursion error, which I hoped would not happen. This makes me think that I have not implemented this cost function in the way that Theano would like and so I am hoping to get some guidance on how to improve this code so that it works. \n\n","retrieved_on":1440573712,"ups":1,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/3fidrd/theano_cost_function_question/","link_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","title":"Theano cost function question","secure_media_embed":{},"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"MachineLearning","created_utc":"1438525236","author_flair_text":null,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","hide_score":false}

An optimized code that does the same thing just faster, is often larger and could be understood through the simpler prototype.\n\nThere are not many kinds of intelligence. There are many things to think about. Mountcastle, referenced in recent years papers by Jeff Hawkins and Ray Kurzweil, wrote a neurscience paper about neocortex (which is a majority of our brains and thinks abstractly) working the same way in all its parts. When parts of a brain are damaged, other parts take over the lost functions.\n\nNeural networks, harmony search, evolution, and many other parts of AI minds are each very small components.\n\nFor example, [Entropica](http://entropica.com) is an equation that acts toward keeping its longterm options open in an entropy context, so its normal behavior is to keep a pole balanced, or to swing it up if already fallen, since that increases its avaiable choices in the future to continue balancing it or let it fall, compared to the lower chance if being able to swing it up again if it has already fallen.\n\n[AIXI](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/AIXI) is based on a similarly simple theory. It uses bayesian statistics on, in theory all but in practice random samples of, ways it could modify itself (or some language describing its strategies) which considers which changes to itself would result in finding better strategies longterm. AIXI learned to play Pacman similar to Deepmind learned to play Atari games, using a grid of symbols were the pixels or tiles are and trying to maximize sum of score over time.\n\nBut do any of the very small AIs get the job done? Are they too small? Einstein said \"Make things as simple as possible, but not simpler.\" We shouldnt remove code that significantly improves the AI's behaviors or efficiency, but we shouldnt write or keep code that can be derived by the AI since it will understand itself better and lead to smarter AI longterm.\n\nThis is not how AI is normally built. People are usually in a rush to solve a few real world problems, so they're happy to skip the AI deriving its own algorithms step. As usual, the profoundly unifying equations are discovered by few while the rest of the world isnt looking. Are there more or less people looking for a unifying equation or code of intelligence than there are looking for a unified field equation?

I have access to a large cluster of computers (running hadoop, but that's not necessarily important) and I want to know if I might be able to take advantage of them when I have a good amount of data. How do large companies train neural nets using large numbers of clustered computers? Is there a standard for it?\n\n2) how do I go about formatting time series data so that it can be properly fed into the neural net? Should I break it up into chunks and feed some sort of magnitude of the chunk? Should I simply feed in each sample I get from my accelerometer? Is there a \"best\" or recommended way to feed in time series data? I want the data to be shift invariant bexuase it will be running continuously once the training is done.\nIs there a recommended form for the data to take? I could feed in the time series, or a spectrogram of the frequency magnitudes, etc\n\n3) what \"knobs\" should I know about to adjust the neural network? How do Recurrent Neural Networks differ from regular feed forward+backprop ANNs?\n\nSorry if these are a little broad, I am just getting my feet wet with Recurrent Neural Networks and its been some time since I took my machine learning class in college.\n\nP.s.

I am currently performing a small machine learning study and would love your input on one challenge I am facing. \nI am training a random forest (sklearn) regression model on a small dataset (approx. 300 data points). We have a hypothesis that a specific subset of these 300 data points (approx 10% of the data, so 30 data points) are \"more important\" in terms of creating a \"more accurate\" model. This subset is fixed, it origins from a different data source than the remaining 90%. I am looking for ways to test this hypothesis by putting a meaningful number to this subset and see whether, in fact, the \"special\" 10% are more important, less important, or equivalent for the remaining dataset. Unfortunately, I have no external test data available.\n\nMaybe an additional explanation what I mean with \"data important to train a more accurate model\": the extreme case for \"unimportant\" data would probably be duplicates in the data, as they do not add additional information to the model (except for maybe the data distribution). However, I think it is insufficient to consider \"data similarity\" as a measure of importance, because similar entries (in variable space) with strongly different target value might actually be both very important to data points in their surroundings better.\n\nI did a bit of research and could only find a study by Fu et al (\"Representing financial time series based on data point importance\"), which exclusively addresses the issue on the specific case of time-series data.\n\nDo you know about any study that measured \"data point importance\" for a generic regression problem?

I want to be very clear that I am not posting because I want someone to give me the answer -- I just want help to understand what is happening.\n\nWe are learning about PCA and preprocessing. My understanding is that PCA is all about trying to collapse multiple colinear variables together into one factor, and that the PCA algorithm tries to find the best linear combination of these while using the least number of variables. For example, if I have 5 correlated highly variables, the PCA might find that just using 4 of them in a certain combination explains the most variance. Then, when you do the training, it applies whatever that combination of variables and coefficients was a single predictor instead of the individual variables (is that right)?\n\nWhat I am having trouble understanding is what is happening behind the scenes. For example, in a lecture, there are 58 variables in a dataset (the 58th is the DV) and we are trying to use PCA for prediction. I am trying to understand what the code does and what sort of objects it is creating, and this is where I could use some help.

As we would like all readers to verify the facts within a short period of time (perhaps 10 to 20 minutes), we have uploaded a dozen of PDF files with highlights and annotations clearly showing the following: \n\n1. The kernel (or constrained-optimization-based) version of ELM (ELM-Kernel, Huang 2012) is identical to kernel ridge regression (for regression and single-output classification, Saunders ICML 1998, as well as the LS-SVM with zero bias; for multiclass multi-output classification, An CVPR 2007).\n\n2. ELM-SLFN (the single-layer feedforward network version of the ELM, Huang IJCNN 2004) is identical to the randomized neural network (RNN, with omission of bias, Schmidt 1992) and another simultaneous work, i.e., the random vector functional link (RVFL, with omission of direct input-output links, Pao 1994).\n \n3. ELM-RBF (Huang ICARCV 2004) is identical to the randomized RBF neural network (Broomhead-Lowe 1988, with a performance-degrading  randomization of RBF radii or impact factors).\n \n4. In all three cases above, Huang got his papers published after excluding a large volume of very closely related literature.\n\n5. Hence, all 3 \"ELM variants\" have absolutely no technical originality, promote unethical research practices among researchers, and steal citations from original inventors. For easy verifications on the origins of the ELM, with annotated PDF files, please visit: \n \nhttp://elmorigin.wix.com/originofelm \n \nPlease forward this message to your contacts so that others can also study the materials presented at this website and take appropriate actions, if necessary.\n\nELM: The Sociological Phenomenon\n \nSince the invention of the name \u201cextreme learning machines (ELM)\u201d in 2004, the number of papers and citations on the ELM has been increasing exponentially. How can this be imaginable for the ELM comprising of 3 decade-old algorithms published by authors other than the ELM inventor? This phenomenon would not have been possible without the support and participation of researchers on the fringes of machine learning. Some (unknowingly and a few knowingly) love the ELM for various reasons:\n \n\u2022  Some authors love the ELM, because it is always easy to publish ELM papers in an ELM conference or an ELM special issue. For example, one can simply take a decade-old paper on a variant of RVFL, RBF or kernel ridge regression and re-publish it as a variant of the ELM, after paying a small price of adding 10s of citations on Huang\u2019s \u201cclassic ELM papers\u201d.\n \n\u2022  A couple of editor-in-chiefs (EiCs) love the ELM and offer multiple special issues/invited papers, because the ELM conference &amp; special issues will bring a flood of papers, many citations and therefore high impact factors to their low quality journals. The EiCs can claim to have faithfully worked within the peer-review system, i.e. the ELM submissions are all rigorously reviewed by ELM experts.\n \n\u2022  A few technical leaders, e.g. some IEEE society officers, love the ELM, because it rejuvenates the community by bringing in more activities and subscriptions.\n \n\u2022   A couple of funding agencies love the ELM, because they would rather fund a new sexy name, than any genuine research.\n \nOne may ask: how can something loved by so many be wrong?\n \nA leading cause of the current Greek economic crisis was that a previous government showered its constituents with jobs and lucrative compensations, in order to gain their votes, thereby raising the debt to an unsustainable level. At that time, the government behavior was welcome by many, but led to severe consequences. Another example of popularity leading to a massive disaster can be found in WW II as Hitler was elected by popular votes.\n \nThe seemingly small price to pay in the case of the ELM is the diminished publishing ethics, which, in a long run, will fill the research literature with renamed junk, thereby making the research community and respected names, such as IEEE, Thomson Reuters, Springer and Elsevier, laughing stocks. Similar to that previous Greek government and its supporting constituents, the ELM inventor and his supporters are \u201cborrowing\u201d from the future of the entire research community for their present enjoyment! It is time to wake up to your consciousness.\n \nOur beloved peer-review system was grossly abused and failed spectacularly in the case of the ELM. It is time for the machine learning experts and leaders to investigate the allegations presented here and to take corrective actions soon.\n\n5 Easy but Proven Steps to Academic Fame\n\n1. The Brink of Genius: Take a paper published about 20 years ago (so that the original authors have either passed away, retired, or are too well-established/generous to publicly object. Unfortunately, pioneers like Broomhead and Pao have passed away). Introduce a very minor variation, for example, by fixing one of the tunable parameters at zero (who cares if this makes the old method worse, as long as you can claim it is now different and faster). Rewrite the paper in such a way that plagiarism software cannot detect the similarity, so that you are not in any of the \u201cIEEE 5 levels of plagiarism\u201d. Give a completely new sensational name (hint: the word \u201cextreme\u201d sounds extremely sexy). \n\n2. Publication: Submit your paper(s) to a poor quality conference or journal without citing any related previous works.\n\n3. Salesmanship: After publishing such a paper, now it is time to sell the stolen goods! Never blush. Don't worry about ethics. Get your friends/colleagues to use your \u201cbig thing\u201d. Put up your Matlab program for download. Organize journal special issues, conferences, etc. to promote these unethical research practices among junior researchers who would just trust your unethical publications without bothering to read the original works published in the 1980s or 1990s. Of course, the pre-requisite for a paper to be accepted in your special issues/conferences is 10s of citations for your unethically created name and publications. Invite big names to be associated with your unethically created name as advisory board members, keynote speakers, or co-authors. These people may be too busy to check the details (with a default assumption that your research is ethical) and/or too nice to say no. But, once \u201cinfected\u201d with your unethically created name, they will be obliged to defend it for you. \n\n4. The Smoke Screen: Should others point out the original work, you claim not to know the literature while pointing to a minor variation that you introduced in the first place. Instead of accepting that your work was almost the same as the literature and reverting back to the older works, you promote your work by: (1) repeating the tiny variation; (2) excluding the almost identical works in the list of references or citing and describing them incorrectly; (3) excluding thorough experimental comparisons with nearly identical works in the literature so that worse performance of your minute variations will not be exposed; (4) making negative statements about competing methods and positive statements about your unethically created name without solid experimental results using words like \u201cmay\u201d or \u201canalysis\u201d; (5) comparing with apparently different methods. You can copy the theories and proofs derived for other methods and apply to your method (with tiny variation from those in the old literature) claim that your method has got a lot of theories while others do not have.\n\n5. Fame: Declare yourself as a research leader so that junior researchers can follow your footsteps. Enjoy your new fortune, i.e., high citations, invited speeches, etc. You don\u2019t need to be on the shoulders of giants, because you are a giant! All you have to do to get there is to follow these easy steps! \n\nOne can call the above steps \u201cIP\u201d (Intelligent Plagiarism), as opposed to stupid (verbatim) plagiarism specified by the IEEE in \u201c5 levels\u201d. The machine learning community should feel embarrassed if \u201cIP\u201d (Intelligent Plagiarism) was originally developed and/or grandiosely promoted by this community, while the community is supposed to create other (more ethical) intelligent algorithms to benefit the mankind.\n","retrieved_on":1440552314,"ups":2,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":0,"archived":false,"id":"3grljn","gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t3_3grljn","author":"ELM_Xposed","from":null,"is_self":true,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","from_kind":null,"created":1439414944,"secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/3grljn/homepage_on_the_origins_of_the_extreme_learning/","from_id":null,"stickied":false,"quarantine":false,"edited":false,"score":2}

I have a set of difficulties I'm running into., but the main one is the difference between an article that is \"about\" a topic and one that mentions a topic.\n\nI'm willing to go through a large set of articles (1000? more?), and tag them either \"About\" or \"Mention\". Basically, I want to be able to filter out articles that are not really about a certain topic, but just mention the keyword. So, if I'm looking for articles on Interviewing, I don't want articles where a person is being interviewed aka \"Interview with Mr. X about cars\" to come up in my results. If I'm looking for articles about commuting, how can filter out articles like this (http://www.psfk.com/2012/07/ipad-kindle-tablets.html) which really is about Ipads and only mentions commuting in passage.\n\nMy hunch is I need run some sort of Machine learning algorithm with features that consider topic, and the word's position in a sentence in the title and in the article (by using a Part-of-speech tagger). But it's just a general idea, and I'm not sure how to exactly achieve this, let alone get good results. \n\nIf you have any tips or know of tools that would help, please let me know!\n\nThanks\n\n\n\n","permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/3guycb/ml_for_improving_search_results_and_information/","link_flair_text":null,"is_self":true,"author":"minervaxox","from":null,"post_hint":"self","id":"3guycb","archived":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"name":"t3_3guycb","over_18":false,"saved":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":2,"quarantine":false,"edited":false,"score":3,"stickied":false,"created":1439483461,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","from_kind":null,"secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/3guycb/ml_for_improving_search_results_and_information/","from_id":null}

You will quickly find what is the background and what are characters not because of visual patterns, but because character pixels move together.\n\nRNN-convnets may be hard to implement, but simple convnets would do the job, with more input channels. Instead of RGB, we put RGBx5 to do 5 timesteps, so 15 input channels instead of 3, nothing else to change in the algorithm.\n\nInstead of just learning borders in the first layer, we would learn borders with motion on one side and no motion on the other side, and the direction of the motion.\n\nMaking datasets wouldn't be such a hard task given the large amount of videos we have today (or video games).\n\nAre there papers on those ideas ?","media":null,"ups":36,"retrieved_on":1440548665}

They only have two gates: one that decides how much to reset the hidden state, and one that decides how much to take the current input into account. It doesn't seem to me like either of these gates should help solve the vanishing gradient problem. The input gate certainly doesnt, as all it can do is ignore an input. But the reset gate should't be able to help either -- if it resets the hidden state, all error signals terminate there, which makes the gradient vanish; if it doesn't reset the hidden state, it's essentially the same as a vanilla RNN, which runs into the vanishing gradient problem.\n\nDoes anyone have any good resources to answer this question?\n\nThanks!","media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/3h4tuy/how_do_grus_solve_the_vanishing_gradient_problem/","secure_media_embed":{},"title":"How do GRUs solve the vanishing gradient problem?","thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"distinguished":null,"hide_score":false,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1439672546","subreddit":"MachineLearning","media_embed":{},"edited":false,"score":18,"quarantine":false,"stickied":false,"from_id":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","created":1439676146,"from_kind":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/3h4tuy/how_do_grus_solve_the_vanishing_gradient_problem/","secure_media":null,"is_self":true,"from":null,"author":"nnnoob123","link_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t3_3h4tuy","gilded":0,"archived":false,"id":"3h4tuy","num_comments":11,"author_flair_css_class":null,"over_18":false,"saved":false}

They seem amazing but the more I learn about them the \"less magical\" they appear.\n\nTo me it seems this is no more than just a fitting tool. You give a \"generic model\" with a lot of parameters a lot of data and try to fit the data as best as you can with this generic model. If your model doesn't work you just add more layers or neurons.\n\nFor example I have played with a simple character recognition. I followed a book and I get 95% success. It has 50k characters and validates with 10k independent data. Problem is as I said this seems to me no more than a fitting tool. I don't really see the patter recognition. For instance, if I move on purpose my numbers to the right side of the image they start to fail to be recognized. If it really \"learns patterns\" moving the number should not be a problem, should it? However, if it's just a fitting tool it makes sense this behavior.\n\nIf I want to predict things for example as far as I know I need also again a lot of data. This seems to me that what it does is to find some coefficients that fit the data so good (after so many different entries) that at the end if I put something \"new\" the parameters chosen in the neurons will still give a plausible result. If I'm right on this I should be able to design other \"generic models\" to fit data which I'm planning on doing eventually.\n\nAdding layers make sense and you normalize to 0-1 so you don't have unexpected results for new data. It makes sense rather than having for example a neuron defined as sum(wi*xi+b). Since in each layer the data will be similar it makes sense to normalize the output of the previous layer to 0-1. However I'm sure this again is not needed and just helps to improve the solution. Again, since this is a fitting tool you can get the same result (or a similar one) either adding neurons or adding layers also. However, it makes more sense in certain situations to add layers instead of adding too many neurons. For instance, to create a number recognition in binary you just add a layer to transform from decimal to binary. You can mathematically do the same by adding much more neurons but you only need 4 neurons to pass from dec-&gt;binary if you use a new layer and there's no way to minimize this number. Even though adding more neurons instead of a new layer will also work since this is a fitting the optimum is to create a new layer since you only need 4 extra neurons.\n\nAgain, I'm very new to this topic so I would like to know from more experienced people if this is not in fact what's going on and I would like if you could provide me some examples that challenge this idea.\n\nAfter all, NN work even if they lack that magical pattern recognition abilities and turn out to only fit data.\n\nThank you and let's try to have a nice discussion on the matter.","retrieved_on":1440543030,"ups":6}

Why doesn't the learning process gets stuck?","link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/3hcijy/is_it_really_appropriate_to_use_a_gradientbased/","selftext":"Hello, there's a problem that's been bugging my mind because it not only affects Neural Networks but some of my work (which is a bit unrelated) and maybe there's a simple proof I'm missing.\n\nThe problem in mind is that when we want a NN to learn we use an optimization method to modify the parameters of the network to minimize the error between the wanted output and the output the network gives. The design of the error function as well as other things can change but that's the main idea.\n\nAs far as I know (I may be wrong here) then we use a gradient-based method to optimize the machine parameters (that is to learn). I say as far as I know because that's what they use in the book I'm reading and from what I know from optimization theory I don't see any other appropriate method (at least one that is also fast enough). The problem is that a gradient-based method does not guarantee to find a global minimum. What this means is that the perfect network may have 99% success for example but because we optimize the parameters with a gradient based method we may finish with a network with 20% success. The reason is that the method may find a local minimum at 20% success and will not continue. That's how a gradient-based method works.\n\nHowever, it seems that the NN always have good solutions or at least the book hasn't mentioned a problem (yet). My intuition tells me that as the number of parameter grows the likelihood of having a lot of local minimas is reduced. However it's hard to prove and I would like to know if there's a simple explanation of why using a gradient-based method seems to work. Intuitively we can think that with SO many parameters it's very hard to find a set of parameters from which computing the error gradient yields a value close to zero for ALL other than the actual (and maybe unique) minimum. Is it as simple as this? Any reference I could cite?","media":null,"ups":5,"retrieved_on":1440542300}

My school offers two hefty proof based abstract algebra courses that don't seem like a whole lot of  fun to me; but I'll take em if they'll be useful. I'm also planning to take proof based courses in probability and stochastic processes. Anything else I should add to the list? ","media":null}

If you can list any relevant resources (papers, webpages, etc.), that would be really helpful.\n\nIn addition, I've noticed that high-dimensional statistical learning is closed related with machine learning research. For example, the idea of penalized regularization in high-dimensional statistics was used in machine learning domain, like support vector machine, boosting tree, (sparse) additive models, etc. My question is,\n\n* what are good research papers about the interplay of high-dimensional statistics and machine learning?\n\nLast, since high-dimensional statistics was really motivated by genetic research (like gene-expression analysis, or genome-wide association studies), most of applications in high-dimensional research are devoted in that area.\n\n* Are there any successful applications of high-dimensional statistics in areas other than genetics, particularly say, image/text mining, recommendation, etc, areas where machine learning techniques have long been used?\n\n* I might be wrong, but as I understand most machine learning algorithms are designed for low-dimensional problems (or at least the number of features is smaller that number of observations). Are there any successful applications of machine learning techniques for modeling high-dimensional data?\n\nAny resources/comments are highly appreciated. Thanks.\n","media":null}

The network can be trained in real time, requiring only about one millisecond per observation. Using the resulting neural network for prediction is extremely fast. This is with stock server hardware. The results are robust even if the data is noisy or it experiences concept drift. There is only one tunable parameter and its exact value is not critical. Even relatively non-technical users can get good results with the algorithm.\n\nThe original version of the code is in Haskell. I have been working on JavaScript and C++ versions. I believe it is patentable technology, though that is not a personal goal of mine. It should go without saying that it is the result of many years of experience with neural networks.\n\nI do not have the financial means to launch a company to take advantage of this algorithm.

Writing research papers is just not something that I do. i.e., no interest and no time.\n\nThe design goal of the code was to provide good results quickly via a very user friendly API. The robustness and concept drift features were added to make the code easier to use, if that makes sense. Researchers tend to care about 0.0001% better accuracy at the cost of days of runtime on a GPU. I did not set out to compete with them in any way.\n\nI do not work in a lab. I work in the real world. I wrote the code for a specific commercial application. But I can see uses in many other settings. I have not come across any open source libraries that are even close to what I wrote. They tend to be toolkits for machine learning experts.\n\nSeveral have suggested testing the code against MNIST. Looking into it. I already know the results would be good but not great. I know I cannot compete with an expert using an existing toolkit. But I'll bet my code could easily beat a non-expert using another toolkit. Hope that clears things up.","media":null,"ups":0,"retrieved_on":1440534848,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/3hs8ci/user_for_great_neural_network_library/","from":null,"author":"BrainyGuy","is_self":true,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":27,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"name":"t3_3hs8ci","link_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"archived":false,"id":"3hs8ci","edited":1440164495,"score":0,"quarantine":false,"from_id":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/3hs8ci/user_for_great_neural_network_library/","secure_media":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","from_kind":null,"created":1440117839,"stickied":false}

I am wanting to combine the answers of more than one predictor to get better answers on each testing example.\n\nNow, most of you have probably heard of ensembles/meta-predictors/committees etc. The basic idea is to combine the answers from more than one predictor to get a more accurate answer. The easiest way of combining predictors is to simply use a majority vote, and this often works well. However, when one predictor is not so good, then majority vote may not be the best way to go.\n\nI want to combine predictors in a way that is based on the performance of the predictors according to the features of the training examples. \n\nHere is what I mean by this. Consider two predictors, P1 and P2, predicting data that has two features, F1 and F2, for two classes, C1 and C2. P2 may have a much better performance on the training set, but maybe P1 gets the right answer (and P2 doesn't) when F1 and F2 are small. Naively, we can guess that if a testing example has small values for F1 and F2, we would assign P1 a higher weight, even if P2 has a much better performance overall. \n\nOne way of using this information might be to cluster the examples that each predictor gets right, and see how far away a new testing example is from the centroid. But there is a big problem--when we talk about whether or not a predictor gets an example right, we mean that it chose the correct class. But if one predictor (say P1) just chooses all examples as C1, for example, it will always do better than the other predictor on that class! Put another way, if a testing example were close to P1's centroid, it wouldn't make sense for P1 to have any input on the answer, since it just guessed C1 on everything.\n\nI'm sure someone has looked into this problem before. It seems like the way to combine predictors in this way would be a \"simple\" algorithm; however, I don't know off the top of my head how to tackle it. I have some preliminary work I've done, but haven't come to any conclusions yet. \n\nIf anyone has any comments, or knows of some things off the top of their head, that would be great! Or, if anyone wants to just discuss the problem, that would be fun, too. At the moment, I am going to look into the Google search, \"combining classifiers in feature space\" and see what I can get from there.","media":null,"ups":2,"retrieved_on":1440532537,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":2,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"name":"t3_3hx6q5","link_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"archived":false,"id":"3hx6q5","from":null,"author":"IndianSurveyDrone","is_self":true,"from_id":null,"from_kind":null,"created":1440211042,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/3hx6q5/need_advice_on_the_use_of_ensembles_ie_1/","secure_media":null,"stickied":false,"edited":false,"score":2,"quarantine":false}

I also might try to adjust/transform the features in such a way that they would no longer be binary.\n\nIs there an algorithm that could be used to predict the latitude/longitude to varying levels of precision? If I hypothetically have up to N decimals of precision on the lat/long data, I would imagine that some items can be predicted all the way to N decimals, some items might only be predictable to n-1 or n-2 decimal places.\n\nOne thing I was considering was using a random forest (or similar method) to classify the first decimal that I am concerned about, which can have 10 possible values (0-9). Then, I could separate each possible value for the second decimal, third, etc, and give each one their own model. Given that this would have to be done separately for lat/long, it seems like it would generate a large number of models for even three decimal places. It might not be a problem for the amount of data I am using, but it is probably not the best approach.","retrieved_on":1440530926,"ups":5}

But first, some background info:\n\nI'm a computer science major starting my 3rd year in university shortly, and after a summer pushing paper in a really lame office job I realize it's time I start getting my shit together.\n\n The only programming experience I have is whatever I've learned in school so far (spent my first 2 years involved in random stuff unrelated to CS), which honestly feels like nothing. I know that my main areas of interest though are machine learning/deep learning, computational neuroscience and bio/neuro inspired computing (think google's DeepMind, maybe even the Human Brain Project, etc) but beyond that, I don't know much about the fields specifically. \n\nThis year I'm really looking to start digging deeper in these areas to hopefully get a better understanding of them and narrow down my interests. I figure a PhD is most definitely in my future but I know for a fact that I do not want to work in academia. \n\nOkay, onto the questions:\n\n1. What are the most interesting jobs you have ever done or heard of that involved machine learning?\n\n2. Realistically, are there any industry, non-research jobs that involve comp neuro? (I'm aware that this probably isn't the best subreddit to ask that one, but incase anyone has an answer I'll ask it anyway, if not that's okay) \n\n3. What should I do during and after my undergrad degree (besides research and a PhD) to be qualified for the kinds of jobs mentioned in 1. And 2? \n\nI realize this post is all over the place and probably goes beyond the scope of this subreddit but any help or advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you :)","media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/3i9a0c/some_questions_from_a_cs_undergrad_student_about/","secure_media_embed":{},"title":"Some Questions from a CS undergrad student about jobs in machine learning","thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"distinguished":null,"hide_score":false,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1440454500","subreddit":"MachineLearning","media_embed":{}}

The thing is, I collected any kind of photos: \"good\" ones, where the object is clearly visible, as well as \"bad\" ones, where the quality is awful or the object is something like a blot.\n\nIn my test set I use only good photos, in order to have a sound performance evaluation.

Think of it like multiple grids of *m*x*n* pixels, where each pixel is the value of that attribute, and each grid is an image. I'm sorry I can't be more specific, but since the data isn't my own (and I'm just an intern), I can't share it here.\n\nMy task is to predict the values of one of the attributes, given some other attributes. So it's sort of a real-valued regression problem, where I predict the value of each pixel (attribute) in a grid. So far, I have used convolutional nets with decent results for a lot of labels, but I need good predictions with very few labeled samples. \n\nOther people working on this have good results with conditional random fields, but my project is based on neural nets.

In this case, I average the probability outputs together to obtain my final probability of belonging to a class or not. It seems like my simple average is probably not the optimal method.\n\nSo the question is - what is the best method to average the output of the individual classifiers?\n\nI'm guessing that it depends on accuracy - ie I should probably weigh the more accurate models heavier. I'm also guessing that it depends on inter-model correlation - ie two correlated models should be weighted less than a model that produces totally uncorrelated errors. I'm just not too sure how to approach this in a rigorous manner.\n\nIs there established literature or an optimal procedure for a problem like this?

The Ai is in  a 'world' divided into 'regions', each with 'subregions', where the ai needs to overcome obstacles in its path. \n\nRight now the fitness function just wants the ai to go to the path, so it's not doing any novelty test/reward. \n\nNeither am I knowledgeable about stats or anything, but so far the best thing I've thought of so far is aggregating the final stats of the genomes to a point, and then testing how far these are from one another, but I'm not sure how I can choose non-arbitrary numbers for that kind of thing. \n\nI've got the ai's x and y positions of deaths, and my first step has been to generate a heatmap of those states and then reward the ones which make it past the common failure regions more.\n\nThoughts? Ideas? \n\nHow have you done this yourself?","media":null}

I was just thinking about the different probability distributions I am going to draw from and the humans that  labeled the movies beforehand learned from. Humans obviously didn't had a labeled set of atmospheres of a movie (like spooky, thoughtful) but rather learned these concepts in a totally unrelated domain like inter human communication or media. We then transferred these labelling abilities to movies (by watching and judging them). I am going to learn on metadata obviously, like genre and synopsis.\n\nI was asking myself whether or not this type of learning is being researched right now (learning from an unrelated prob. distribution and applying it to another one) and how the state of the art is. I found domain adaption at wikipedia, but I feel like the article is more about fitting learned concepts to similar ones (not sure though, it is kept pretty short). I guess in the context of deep learning we could develop some deeper understandings of things like spooky and apply them to an entirely new domain (implying we can normalise the underlying representations, right? Or find a common representation space?). Though I fear that this is not going to happen anytime soon I'd like to hear about your thoughts or any hints on previously done research!

Although I have a resonably small training / test set (trainig = 300 instances, test = 20 instances), when I'm testing with other instances I might not get 100%, which I think proves that my classifier does not overfit, but still he is saying that 100% is never good.\n\nI'm assuming that getting consistent 100% correct evaluation is worse than getting in some scenarios.

{"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/3j31t6/absolute_beginner_got_75_accuracy_for_customer/","selftext":"**TL;DR: explaining a process of getting the results, maybe an inspiration and or / starting point for others, if I got it right (which I doubt, but that's why I got some questions in here :)**\n\nMany of our customers would love to have customer churn prediction built into their product. So with limited knowledge, onto the project I went. I got some preliminary results, but I'd have some (probably basic) questions for you pro's.\n\nThe customers are members who visit the place frequently (1-30 times a month). We have data about customer visits, and the history of purchases made. First, I created a script to fetch customer data:\n\n    for (account in accounts) {\n      // from the beginning of customership onwards until the customer remains a customer\n      for (month in [1..36]) {\n        calculateVector(); \n      }\n    }\n\nso for each customer, I calculated a data vector for each month beginning from their customership. The vector contained the amount of visits, and as a last column a boolean flag whether customer was still a customer three months after. So for a customer, who had been to the place in January 3 times, February 4 times and March 5 times, April 2 times, May 1 times, and quit then, the vectors would be like:\n\n    [3,0,0,0,0,0,1] // jan; still customer in april (3months)\n    [4,3,0,0,0,0,1] // feb: still customer in may\n    [5,4,3,0,0,0,0] // mar: won't be customer anymore in june\n    [2,5,4,3,0,0,0] // apr\n    [1,2,5,4,3,0,0] // may\n    [0,1,2,5,4,3,0] // jun\n... and so on, eventually being a lot of zeroes. This is a sample of customer with not very long history, but most customers are with longer history.\n\nValues are normalized between -1 and 1.\n\nDataset contains 50.000 items, about 50-50 for the both classes (1, 0). I shuffled the dataset, and split it into 70% of training data and 30% validation data.\n\nI quickly got into 75% validation accuracy, and so far checking the customers by probability the results seem to be correct. Although, there's some seasonal fluctuation in the usage, and now the dataset doesn't take this into account, predicting a lot of customers for ending customership even though they were just having summer holidays.\n\nParameters: input vector size: 36 (months), one hidden layer with 100 units, learning rate 0,1 decay 0,01 momentum 0,9, loss function mse, batch size 32, 100 epochs\n\nHowever, here's some questions that arose:\n\n* What do you think about my process of getting the data vectors?\n* Does it sound reasonable that the highest accuracy is already gained in first or second epoch? Or could it be possible that I hit a local minimum? Somehow I always thought that you need to train at least for minutes?\n* Loss decrease stalls very soon. I understand this means that the model is not learning anymore, and I've hit either local minimum or global minimum?\n* Is there any way to know whether I'm hitting local or global minimum? I guess with this dataset a 75% accuracy is already good one (can't predict if people move to other city, etc)\n* Any ideas why does the accuracy decrease from 75% to 65% if I use a week as a step size instead of a month? The vector size is 156 (3y*52 weeks). By common sense, having more accurate data should provide highe\nr accuracy?\n* Also, the accuracy decreases to mere 60% if I add the customer purchases to the vector, any ideas why is this? So in this case I'd have a vector of [visits,purchases,class]? e.g. [2,5,4,3,0,0,0,200,0,0,1] wher\ne 2,5,4,3 are visits and 200 is purchase amount. I normalized each column separately. The dataset size was 360.000 items.\n* Should it have any effect if I change \"non-customer\" values from zero to -1? E.g. now the first data set has [3,0,0,0....] where zeroes would indicate no visits, but the customer actually started in the first\nmonth (with 3 visits).\n* Any other data that you'd suggest me to try for this model?
