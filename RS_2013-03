Presumably the complicated MCD algorithms provide some major advantage over the multivariate MAD approach - what would they be? Is there some big flaw with the MAD method? (In 1D it looks to work quite well).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also presumably with this approach my obtained covariance matrix will no longer be Wishart distributed so downstream considerations based on that might not apply?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any advice appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[EDIT]: &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/cwyVinD.png\"&gt;bonus figure&lt;/a&gt; to show the sort of data I am working with.

I am completely lost with respect to the QMDP formula found at http://dai.fmph.uniba.sk/~petrovic/probrob/ch16.pdf . You calculate Q(x_i,u) for every action and for one specific state (since there is no for loop),and then in the final line it asks you to sum over all states x_i but you've only worked out Q(x_i,u) for one specific state previously! I am completely confused by this.**\n\nRelevant links that may or may not help:\n\nhttp://dai.fmph.uniba.sk/~petrovic/probrob/ch16.pdf - QMDP algorithm is near the top\n\nhttp://dai.fmph.uniba.sk/~petrovic/probrob/ch14.pdf - MDP discrete value iteration is near the bottom too \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_observable_Markov_decision_process - POMDP's in general.\n\nThank you in advance!\n\n","link_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/1b5tr8/not_sure_if_this_is_the_place_for_a_reinforcement/"}
