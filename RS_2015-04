{"media":null,"selftext":"I'm working on a proposal for a grad school project in my ML class and what I would like to do is to analyze Twitter data and do information extraction to detect in real-time the status of events that may or may not happen - currently I'm thinking concerts, but that might be subject to change. So for example, if it's done in a supervised fashion, I'd look at tweets mentioning \"Band ABC\" and seek to classify them as either 1) the event is happening, 2) the event is not happening/cancelled, 3) not related to the event's status (which will be most of them, causing a large class imbalance, so it seems that I'd need to score by F1 rather than precision).\n\nI thought I would use the Twitter NLP package here https://github.com/aritter/twitter_nlp to perform NER/POS tagging on the tweets. The author of the toolkit also created a tool that extracts events from Twitter and details his approach in this paper http://aritter.github.io/rt080-ritter.pdf.\n\nReading through the paper, it would appear that my task is somewhat similar, but in my task the domain would be closed rather than open, which should make things easier. However, as far as the actual classification of tweets, I'm looking for some advice: should I use a supervised approach like that author uses as his baseline? The author seems to use an unsupervised method with Bayesian inference to assign probabilities to event categories and it does significantly better than the supervised baseline. My original thought was something like a simple supervised bag of words model, but I'd appreciate any feedback.","retrieved_on":1440819848,"ups":2,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/311x68/graduate_project_question/","link_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"default","title":"Graduate project question","secure_media_embed":{},"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"MachineLearning","created_utc":"1427894378","author_flair_text":null,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","hide_score":false,"quarantine":false,"score":2,"edited":false,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/311x68/graduate_project_question/","secure_media":null,"from_kind":null,"created":1427897978,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","from_id":null,"stickied":false,"author":"[deleted]","from":null,"is_self":true,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"num_comments":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"archived":false,"id":"311x68","link_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t3_311x68","gilded":0}

My guess is that this is because the biases in the network are becoming much larger than the weights though this may not be the real root of the problem.\n\nIn implementing gradient clipping I'm dividing any parameter (weight or bias) by its norm once the latter hits a certain threshold, so e.g. if dw is a derivative:\n\n    if |dw| &gt; threshold:\n        dw = threshold * dw/|dw|\n\nThe problem here is how |dw| is defined.  I'm defining it as sum(abs(dw)) where the sum is over the components of dw but this means components of larger matrices/vectors will be pushed to much smaller values than those of smaller matrices/vectors.  In particular biases will have much larger derivs than weights and this is effectively like giving them a much higher learning rate.  This is why I believe my network is becoming bias driven but I might be wrong.\n\nI don't really understand the rational behind using this particular norm for gradient clipping (rather than e.g. the average value of the components) but it seems to be what others do so I'd like to ask if anyone can explain the rationalization or tell me what I'm doing wrong.","retrieved_on":1440815464,"ups":4,"subreddit":"MachineLearning","media_embed":{},"author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1428070311","hide_score":false,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","distinguished":null,"thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"Gradient clipping RNNs","created":1428073911,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","from_kind":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/31b6x8/gradient_clipping_rnns/","secure_media":null,"from_id":null,"stickied":false,"quarantine":false,"score":4,"edited":false,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":26,"id":"31b6x8","archived":false,"gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t3_31b6x8","author":"spurious_recollectio","from":null,"is_self":true}

This discussion was very helpful and informative for me.\n\n*****\n\nHi /r/MachineLearning,\n\nI posted this on /r/MLQuestions first because that seemed like the right place, but it doesn't seem too active over there.\n\nI'm researching a problem that's a bit out of my comfort zone and I'm not sure where to start.\n\n## The Problem\n\nI'm dealing with pressure readings during package transport. I'm trying to identify when the package takes off and lands during shipment (it's sitting on the tarmac most of the time). This may happen multiple times per shipment. The way I see it, I'm trying to identify occurrences of a similarly-shaped subsequence for each shipment (something akin to finding instances of a particular word in dialogue).\n\nHere are a few details about the data:\n\n- Each instance of the data is a time series representing a single shipment.\n\n- The data is unlabeled (I don't know which points belong to flight vs. tarmac).\n\n- The pressure readings are recorded at regular intervals.\n\n## My First Guess at How to Approach\n\nThis paper:\n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950705111000815\n\ndescribes a method for generating a template for time series data using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). I could hand-pick examples of the subsequence I'm looking for, create a template, then for each shipment, test every subsequence for closeness in the DTW-sense to my template. I'd pick the best ones that don't overlap or something.\n\n## My Questions\n\nMy approach seems super slow. I figure this problem has to be similar enough to something else, but I'm not sure what. I'm not even sure of the name for my problem.\n\nI'm hoping to find some relevant reading material or just some general advice (e.g. another problem similar enough that I could build from it).\n\nThanks in advance!","permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/31mrmn/xpost_rmlquestions_subsequence_identification_in/","link_flair_text":null,"is_self":true,"author":"hammerheadquark","from":null,"id":"31mrmn","archived":false,"name":"t3_31mrmn","gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"num_comments":28,"author_flair_css_class":null,"quarantine":false,"edited":1428415344,"score":6,"stickied":false,"from_kind":null,"created":1428335123,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/31mrmn/xpost_rmlquestions_subsequence_identification_in/","from_id":null}

I'm doing supervised learning with a hand labeled training set.\n\nThe problem is: each item in my data set is a dictionary with approx. 80 keys that are either text, boolean, or integers that I want to use as features. I have about 40,000 items and have hand labeled about 800 of them. Am I meant to select, for example, only boolean features to use, or only integers? Do I need to normalize the features (remove mean + scale to unit variance)? I'm currently not even going to attempt analysis of the text yet so it may be worth not even giving those features to the classifier. Would it be dumb to just try various permutations/combinations of features of the same type (ints)? It could also be that I'm approaching my dataset completely wrong... it's shaped like this:\n\n[ [a, b, c, ...], [a, b, c, ...], [a, b, c, ...], ...] \n\nEssentially what I hope to achieve is a binary classification of each item in the dataset, basically just \"Good\" or \"Bad\" according to what I've hand labeled. I read that some classifiers work better on different data types, like Bernoulli Naive Bayes, and K Nearest Neighbors works when the \"decision boundary is very irregular\".\n\nUltimately I want a comparison of classifier accuracy across several different algorithms, in addition to hopefully isolating one that is actually accurate for classifying my data...\n\nAny insight is appreciated, or if there's a better place to ask!","media":null,"ups":0,"retrieved_on":1440809581,"author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1428344965","subreddit":"MachineLearning","media_embed":{},"hide_score":false,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"distinguished":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"Help with feature selection for supervised learning classification?","from_id":null,"from_kind":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","created":1428348565,"secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/31nlgq/help_with_feature_selection_for_supervised/","stickied":false,"edited":false,"score":0,"quarantine":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":1,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t3_31nlgq","id":"31nlgq","archived":false,"from":null,"author":"Silkut_","is_self":true}

The one notable feature about this data was that it wasn't separable: there were several points where the features were identical but with different labels.\n\nWhen we did straightforward SGD it fit great, we got down to the Bayes error rate for the test data, and everyone was happy.  But the overhead of shuttling data to and from the GPU accounted for a significant portion of our training time.  The obvious solution was minibatching, which we implemented, only to watch our accuracy absolutely collapse.  The model basically never got past the \"choose the most frequent class label\" heuristic, no matter what ridiculous things we did to the network or what sort of update rule we used (SGD, NAG, Adadelta...).  If we dropped the minibatch size low enough (single digits) then it eventually got better, but doing 1 example at a time gave us the best performance as far as both accuracy wall-clock time to train, even with the overhead of moving the data around.\n\nThe network itself (when fit by SGD) was nothing special, 3 hidden layers all with leaky rectified linear units, and a softmax output; pretty much anything we tried seemed to work ok as long as we had 3 or more layers.  \n\nHas anyone run across this sort of thing before?  Any idea what might be behind it?  Our initial thought was that having identical points with differing labels in a single minibatch might be somehow killing the gradients, but even when we experimented with making sure we only had a single version of a given point in any given minibatch, we saw exactly the same thing. \n\nIf it's not obvious by this point, none of us are really neural network experts, so it's quite possible that this is well known and totally obvious, but a few afternoons of googling around hasn't turned anything up for us. \n\nAny ideas?","media":null,"ups":8,"retrieved_on":1440808877,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/31p3xg/minibatching_prevents_neural_networks_from/"}

After reading [this critique of decision trees,](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/pointeurs/bengio+al-decisiontrees-2010.pdf) I can see Bengio's point: decision trees are definite victims of the \"curse of dimensionality\" for problems like the checkerboard.\n\nI was pretty curious to see this in action. I generated an arbitrary checkerboard -- 10x10 for simplicity, coloring each square with a rule like bool(X1 % 2 == 0) ^ bool(X2 % 2 == 1)). For the time being, I plan to not be too evil, restricting the feature space to integers, maintaining class and point balance, etc. I'd like to develop a model that could generalize well to this problem, performing well under the following:\n\n* Have full training data coverage on the 10x10 checkerboard and predict points correctly within that space.\n* Have limited training data coverage on the 10x10 and still predict points correctly. For example, I'd like to drop out all (5, 5) from the training sample, but still predict (5, 5) correctly.\n* Either of the above training scenarios, but correctly predict a point from outside the board (i.e. (11, 11)).\n\nWithout any sort of treatment of the feature space, 1 is easy for most classifiers, given correct parameters and a sufficient data sample (i.e. k in KNN or min_leaf_Samples in DT matching the number of samples per square), 2 is something KNN or DT will get wrong, and 3 is a scenario dictated by luck -- a DT will get (10, 11) wrong but (10, 12) right. I suspect you could get some luck in a highly dimensional checkerboard with Random Forest, but I suspect most of your \"success\" there would be by luck.\n\nAfter working through the mental gymnastics a bit, I understand Bengio's critique. Now, I was hoping to pull some NN code off-the-shelf, train it on some checkerboard data and see how well it did in 2&amp;3. My intuition is that a sufficiently complex architecture should do well on this, but my problem is that I'm a bit of a rookie when it comes to NN and I was hoping you, /r/MachineLearning redditors, could help me out. Since I like Python, I started using theanets. Like I said, but I'm pretty naive to NN and theanets. I tried following the [theanets XOR example](https://github.com/lmjohns3/theanets/blob/master/examples/xor-classifier.py), even modifying to longer and wider architectures (2-20-20-20-20-1) for regression and (2-20-20-20-20-2) for classification, but I'm not getting very good results on any scenario -- 1, 2, or 3.\n\nHave I missed the crux of the generalization point? Am I using theanets/NNs wrong?

The problem is that when I look at the first layer filters, they look really noisy, not smooth and orthogonal like many papers suggest that good ConvNet convergence should produce.  I've played with dropout as a method of regularization at various stages in the ConvNet, but I can't seem to achieve the smooth orthogonal first layer filters.\n\nThe network consists of standard input layer -&gt; conv -&gt; relu -&gt; pool -&gt; drop, combinations, similar to ideas listed in the cs231n class.\n\nI have looked through a lot of papers on ConvNets and watched a lot of online ConvNet classes and lectures.  Nothing I have tried has seemed to produce nice first layer filters.  Also, I just haven't gotten a good intuition about what to try or what to do when I see the first layer filters are not converging to nice smooth/orthogonal filters.\n\nAs a bit of background, I have taken the Andrew Ng Coursera Machine Learning course, completed a few of the UFLDL tutorials (auto-encoders), read many papers, completed lots of tutorials and implemented several 2-4 layer neural network and convolutional neural network examples using Theano and Caffe.  Some example datasets were ones I thought up, some were published ones like MNIST etc..\n\nThings I am about to try...\n1.) So far I have not preprocessed the data.  Subtracting the mean is one of the next things I was going to try...\n2.) Downloading the TinyImageNet images or CIFAR-10 / CIFAR-100, or maybe even MNIST, training a published ConvNet that achieves high accuracy and also produces the nice filters and then tweaking the network until it gets noisy filters.

Which regularization term would you pick given that the test error actually drops below the training error at some point.  See implementation details below.\n\nI just trained a neural network with 33 input units, 10 hidden units, and a single output unit.  The hidden units each use a sigmoid activation function and the final output is just a linear combination of those.  No activation function is used for the output because the goal is regression rather than classification.\n\nI trained the network using backpropagation and some annealing at the end to find a better local minima.  I used a training set of 7800 reserving 2600 for testing the error and 2600 for cross-validation.  The error term I minimized was the mean squared error of the network output with the actual output.\n\nI trained the network in several passes using different l2 regularization constants and I plotted the learning curves here:   http://imgur.com/0CL6LVY.  As expected the training error grows with the regularization term and the training/cv error shrinks.  \n\nMy question is, there is a point when the training error and test error cross and then the testing error becomes and stays smaller than the training error.  In examples I've seen there is an ideal regularization term that minimizes the test set error but it still lies above the training error.  What would cause the test set error to become so low?  Also, which regularization term would you pick?  The one where the test/training error cross or a larger term that further minimized the test set error.

To build such a model one could use a library of flower components and, *in silico*, simulate many possible plant combinations and check to see how well our model matches the image.\n\nThe question is, **what scoring function do we use to compare the model to the image**? A simple one is to project our model into 2D, calculate pixel values and compute a chi-square based on the pixel-wise agreement to the data image. However, while this kind of shape matching will guide us to a good global plant shape, it will become less helpful the closer we get to the right answer.

There is always enough food (so I make sure that this is a robot vs. robot rather than robot vs. environment project). There is a 20% chance of a \"bad food\" appearing. Food increases life span and red dots kill you immediately.\n\nRobots are a set of neural networks, inputs from its two eyes (RGB, health, and I tried adding a \"temporary variable\" which I've removed) to the outputs (Turn left, turn right (both mean go straight), change its own RGB, and set its \"temp var\" which, again I've removed).\n\nFirstly, I use to have it that eating food increased your life and declined the amount of time to have a \"baby\" but I have now removed that so the countdown is always the same.\n\nBut they kept going extinct from the bad food\n\nI added a feature so that bad food would turn into good food after 15 seconds so that the \"last ones living\" would still have a chance. But they kept on going extinct.\n\nSo lastly, just recently, I added a feature that when one dies, if there are less than 10 robots on screen, it WILL reproduce (guaranteed) like before. Now I've just found that \"dumber\" robots sometimes take over. I've tried playing with the mutation setting and such and I am just stuck on how to get the best robot.\n\nI'm hoping to expand this to a \"predator prey\" experiement as well where robots have a \"spike\" that give them food if they hit another robot (drains health) and lose food if they have their spike out at no robot.\n\nSo how do I make sure that they don't go extinct and I get the best selection? How could I expand it so they don't just die off or get stuck being dumb?\n\n[Simulation](http://demipixel.net/evolution/)\n\n*You'll probably want to run it on \"fast\".

I'm also interested in generative modeling of other structures like time series or hierarchical time series.  \n\nVariational Autoencoder - Seems to get good results in practice.  No consistency guarantee.  May not be appropriate if one actually wants a calibrated model (i.e. P(Y &lt; y) is asymptotically correct).  \n\nMixture of Gaussians - Could learn a mixture of multivariate gaussians.  Could scale to high dimensional spaces by requiring each gaussian to have a diagonal covariance matrix.  Should be consistent, but difficult to optimize and very limited in the class of distributions it can model.  \n\nNADE - Fits an RNN over the variables.  Makes most sense if the variables are from a time series or have a natural ordering.  \n\nGenerative Stochastic Networks.  \n\nGenerative Adversarial Networks - Should be consistent, but some have had trouble getting them to work for RNNs.  In my experience they were somewhat hard to optimize, though it could have been due to an error on my end.  \n\nAt least from what I've seen, it seems like we have yet to find a solution that's:\n\n1.  Easy to optimize (but not necessarily convex)\n\n2.  Able to model distributions with a large number of modes.  \n\n3.  Consistent\n\nDoes anyone have a view on which models have the most promise for eventually achieving these properties?  Are there are any important algorithms that I've left out?

I want to know more about this and wondering if you guys can help me out here. here's a little background.\n\n I've been working with a voting records database of a decision making body. By looking at the voting records, I'm hoping to get a better understanding of political dynamics within that body. \n\nAs a coding/programming illiterate, i could only come up a manual way to set up a database, where i type each voting sheets into an excel worksheet. \n\nThis was a hideous job that took me days. One day, I came across this professor's dataverse where he set up a same time of database,  but 20 times larger. I got in touch with him and asked how he managed to collect that much data. The answer was simple: R-script.\n\nAs i said, I don't have much knowledge on statistic, coding or data collection. I spent last couple of weeks figuring out what this R is and has not much clue what i've been reading or practicing online. \n\nCan anyone explain to me how data collection works using R?

It can be direct (ie, eat for energy and then clone yourself or \"die\" from lack of food) or indirect (fixed lifespan, fitness criteria from performed actions, simulation picks the winners).\n- Sometimes genetic algorithms and breeding and sometimes replication with mutation.\n\nNow this is all very interesting, and you can get Ant or Swarm behaviors out of it, but I want to try for more complex behaviors like social interaction because I believe that more complexity will yield more interesting results. Admittedly, the limitations so far may be more from the simulation (ie, my inability to imagine challenges to simulate) than anything.\n\nFound a few things today that got me thinking:\n- http://www.necsi.edu/visual/systems.html , 6 visuals about complexity. \n- http://edgeoforder.org/Inv2.html , in physical terms, complexity seems to arise from the interface of chaotic and orderly regions; in simulation terms, the Agents and their Environment (\"energy balance\" perhaps)\n- http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/280/1755/20122863 , adding a connection cost to neural networks leads to modular networks (which in turn appear more powerful and adaptable). I want to try a cluster design sparsely connected.\n- http://shinyverse.org/larryy/Yaeger.ALife3.pdf , a good rundown of PolyWorld, one of the more interesting sandbox/neural network simulations\n- http://qrng.anu.edu.au/index.php , perhaps using quantum generated random numbers when randomizing simulation environment changes and other things, put a little of the physical world into the simulation?\n\nSome other patterns I thought were interesting (or don't have the article):\n- Networks can tend to seize (too much activity) or die (too little activity); our brains modulate this I think with tonal signals (\"brainwaves\") and I wonder if this kind of \"keep-alive\" signal can help a neural network? Particularly of the spiking variety.\n- Topography of an ANN is critical to its function, but I have no way of knowing what will work in advance, so I need a good method to evolve the structure and weights. I'm not yet sure how to encode the actual structure to its genes (when using GA's) but I normally randomly add/remove/adjust nodes and links and their parameters during mutation. It seems critical for some recurrence to happen (independent of inputs).\n- Most of my \"evolution\" happens at the mutation stage, but this is also mostly random (or feels so). I have yet to find a good way to make the ANN's weights evolve \"at run-time\" to learn during a single life cycle. I feel that is a major impediment to making smarter Agents.\n- One thing I have not seen done, that I think was vital to our own social evolution, is the advancement of communication; some simulations have a basic Agent-Agent communication (let's call it \"Verbal\"), but I've not seen the ability of Agents to drop \"artifacts\" (ie, writing) that span generations and time. It's possible to give Agents a leg up on using something like that; in the same way they can output a neuron high to \"move\" and the simulation deals with the action without the Agent having to learn what movement \"means\", we can \"drop an artifact\" with some data and a time-stamp, and later another Agent can \"pick it up\" or read it, knowing how long has passed and what data it contains. This could lead to novel behaviors.\n- The highest complexity seems to come from cooperation over competition, but both are necessary. The Environment pushes survival (and this evolution), but cooperation is the way to make more complex networks (ie, Agent communication = networks of networks working together).\n- Because I don't program GPUs, I have to limit my simulation processing on my PC; one way that seems good is to penalize excessive computation if it does not result in more intelligent Agents (complexity for the sake of complexity is not always useful). I usually internalize this as an \"energy cost\" of some kind on the organism for larger ANN structures. However, modular ANN is one solution because it's not fully interconnected so it's not like O(N^2) which limits my nodes and connections much more. Not all connections are \"useful\" and brains after all have a cost in real life to be complex.\n- I think part of our intelligence comes from our ability to store inputs in a way that we can feed them back through our pre-processing centers later (dreams, daydreams). The brain is active in the absence of inputs. So, one of my concerns is helping the Agents be able to save inputs for recall (I guess this can be done directly in memory? But how to recall it as a synthetic input without interfering with actual input? and how to make that useful?).\n\nThere are a number of challenges, but besides how to design an Agent's body and brain (which are important too) one of things I run into is: How do I make the simulation demanding enough to force evolution of interesting behaviors, but not so complex that all Agents stall? I'm of the assumption that if we want a behavior we need the sim to reward it; so if we want them to \"talk and write\" we first provide the function then reward them for taking the action. However, that in itself doesn't create the advanced behavior associated with communication or memory.\n\nIn terms of the sorts of \"built-in\" nodes (sensory and action), I wanted to include some kind of recall function where if certain outputs or regions are activated, then stored inputs get set on secondary input nodes (so it's like shadow inputs, but not always active). But, we need to store and recall inputs from a certain *time* and I'm not sure how.\n\nIn other words, not just \"instinctual\" behaviors but planning requires a sense of time/memory. Any ideas?"}

I've run into the notion of hierarchical softmax in the word2vec paper 'Efficient Estimation of Word Representation in Vector Space' by Mikolov et al. (2013) and also in 'A Scalable Hierarchical Distributed Language Model' by Mnih &amp; Hinton (2007) in which a speedup of 200x is noted over the ['normal' softmax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function). I have trouble understanding them. I'll write down how I think it works and what this means in terms of processing complexity. Hopefully you can correct me where I'm wrong.\n\nI understand that there is a short/fast path to each specific word (which is my class type) in the tree. I learned in [Hinton's coursera class](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqsI-X40OBY) that cross entropy is the 'right' cost function for training a softmax and the error derivative of the softmax is y(i)-t(i). So although the path to a specific word is short, this means that all paths to all words must be evaluated.\n\nMnih &amp; Hinton use a feature vector for each node to decide which branch to take. For a fully connected tree the number of nodes has the same complexity (grows as fast) as the number of leaves (minus 1) for a full tree. Assuming that the size of the feature vector is the same as the last layer before the softmax then the number of parameters learned for the tree is the same as a fully connected layer to a softmax.\n\nSo finding the probabilities of all nodes starts with taking the dot product of the previous layer with each of the decision vectors (1 matrix multiplication). Then for each node the logistic function must be calculated and the product must be forwarded in the tree to find the probabilities of the leaves.\n\nHowever, according to my math this takes almost exactly as many calculations as the normal softmax.\nThe normal softmax starts with a matrix multiplication for the fully connected layer below, which is almost as large as the matrix multiplication for the tree. Then the actual softmax is calculated, which is an element-wise exponentiation (which is also necessary for the logistic function) and then a sum (which can be parallelized efficiently in a pairwise tree) to find the normalization term.\n\nSo what part(s) don't I understand correctly? It seems like they have the same computational complexity during training.","media":null,"ups":4,"retrieved_on":1440782480,"created_utc":"1429544788","author_flair_text":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"MachineLearning","domain":"self.MachineLearning","hide_score":false,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","distinguished":null,"preview":{"images":[{"id":"ZQ9mAOKLT4ya1Ek4GnxkFv0lfs6kBq0IY3q3KjD-t1U","variants":{},"resolutions":[{"height":36,"width":108,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/mn0iwRcCqK_Bhd73M9JsGJBuHZ74LKMTaIJOWhFF30Q.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=dd9a52a9c6b6dc8611355e5e18bf0085"}],"source":{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/mn0iwRcCqK_Bhd73M9JsGJBuHZ74LKMTaIJOWhFF30Q.jpg?s=a688958538a39d96048accb74297354f","height":50,"width":149}}]},"title":"Hierarchical Softmax, why is it faster?","secure_media_embed":{}}

For a course for my PhD I have to analyse a real dataset. I chose to analyse the Wisconsin breast dataset. I'm using different classifiers: linear discriminant, quadratic discriminant, parzen and a non linear support vector. What I saw is if I use all the features, the non linear support vector classifier gets the worse results than the others; whereas, if I apply a feature extraction or a feature selection, the support vector classifier gets the better results. As results I mean the average classification error calculated with a cross-validation.\nThe my possible explanation is that in when I use all the features, the two dataset are distinctly separate in the features space and the non-linear classifier introduce an overfitting; while when I apply the feature selection / extraction is able to overcome better the overlap between the two classes. For you, could it be a correct explanation?\n\nThank you.

So, instead of coding the AI, wi will have simply configure a simulation, and AI will be created evolutionary.\n\nI've recently posted the [results](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/31idqb/im_building_evolution_based_ai_toolkit_to/) of my first experiment.\n\nAs you can see, there's some nice progress happened already. The first version of genetical system proved its ability to create a simple control system, but it need improvements and optimization, to gain the ability to leave local optimums for better choices, to find good solutions faster, to have better chances to find the best solution for the task.\n\nSo, what I do these days is change the system, run the simulation and decide if the change is good or not. I need to try different math of on genes level, different mechanics on genome level - how the mutations happen, and also different variants of fitness function on simulation level, to lead the evolution in the correct direction.\n\nThe problem is: every simulation takes too much time. About 10 hours per simulation to say how good a variant.\n\nI have many ideas to try. And it's hard to predict, which would work better. So, there's no slowly pursuing a glimpse of better choice, it's brutal force way of trying everything. I run 2 tests a day, and it's a realy slow progress.\n\nSo, I though, what if I ask people, if they want to run a simulation of two for me, and then upload an image with the results. [Example of image](http://i.imgur.com/iw2Pz2w.png). It's a graph of fitness function of the evolving species.\n\nBenefits for you is to watch some evolution on your computer. Though, I must say, that in most cases the results won't be any exciting, because good solutions are rare, I try new approaches, to see if there some good ways to drive the evolution.\n\n**How I think this may work.**\n\nPretty simple.\n\nYou post \"I could help\". I send you .exe file (for windows). You run it for 2-3K generations (5 - 10 hours). Then you make a screenshot of the graph and send it back to me.\n\nIf there will be at least 20-30 people who agree to help, I could make all the tests in a few days. It would be realy helpful. (Or not, because so far my actual solution works better than the new ones I try).\n\nAlso note: right now I'm talking about only one experiment. \n\nThere are wolves, rabbits, bears, food for wolves and rabbits, also wolves can shoot projectiles to kill wolves, rabbits and bears. Wolves and rabbits evolve.\n\nBut it's only one simple experment. I have about 10 more, untill I start the ultimate one, the one I started all this for. Those simple preliminary experiments supposed to help me to poish the genome system. And you can help me with this.\n\nIf this work, and I'll find ways improve the genome, we may see some exciting new experiments much sooner.","media":null,"ups":0,"retrieved_on":1440778326}

I get a noticeable improvement in cross validation accuracy when I optimize, but my optimization is already a fairly slow process so I'd like to speed it up if I can.  In general, my optimization (using patternsearch()) runs much more quickly when I set constraints on the parameters; right now I'm using random initial conditions between 0 and 1 with the lower and upper limits set to [0 5]. Anyone know what a reasonable upper limit might be? I literally just guessed at this based on allowing a few models without constraints to optimize, but I'm hoping someone could provide some insight based on their knowledge of this parameter or pratical experience.

They are somewhat similar to the Labeled Faces In the Wild dataset, except that the lighting is a lot harder and some of the faces are in the profile view. In general the poses vary quite a lot. One other unusual aspect of the problem is that I will probably have between 500 - 10000 training examples of about 10 different people. Another unusual aspect of the problem is that I'm willing to settle for low recall with high precision. For example, I'd be okay if I could only classify 50% of the faces if I can classify that set with &gt;90% accuracy.\n\nHere are the approaches that I'm considering / prototyping:\n\n-Fisherfaces.\n\n-Sort the instances by pose (just frontal / profile in the simplest case), and build a separate fisherfaces model for each pose. A more sophisticated variant could learn a pose clustering and then use a separate fisherfaces model for each pose.\n\n-Define a distance metric using standard features like SIFT and then do KNN (already tried this and it's not so good, like 10% recall at 90% precision).\n\n-Using a set of standard features like Overfeat (which is mostly trained on non-faces) and then train a shallow classifier (like logistic regression or rf) on top of it.","permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/33iq36/face_recognition_on_faces_in_the_wild_with_1000/","link_flair_text":null,"is_self":true,"author":"alexmlamb","from":null,"id":"33iq36","archived":false,"gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t3_33iq36","over_18":false,"saved":false,"num_comments":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"quarantine":false,"edited":false,"score":6,"stickied":false,"from_kind":null,"created":1429740476,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/33iq36/face_recognition_on_faces_in_the_wild_with_1000/","from_id":null}

My coursework is fairly limited- 2-3 programming classes (stuff upto data structures), and math upto Linear Algebra/Calc III (self-studying linear algebra). I'm a bit torn on my undergrad major- either CS or Physics. I'm interested computational problems in physics- astrophysics and biophysics, and it seems that there's a fair amount of data mining stuff in astrophysics. On the other hand, I'm interested in theoretical parts of CS, but the CS major has more core courses in systems (OS, networking, etc.). It seems that the physics major would be more mathematically rigorous. If any people who studied these subjects could provide their perspective that would awesome. Lastly, I noticed that there are a decent amount of CS professors who studied physics, and that its easier to go from physics to CS than from CS to physics. ","media":null}

I'm a pretty experienced programmer, but I'm not that familiar with machine learning so I'd rather avoid it if I could. \n\nThanks in advance!","permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/33v62w/does_scikit_offer_any_classifier_based_on_rule/","link_flair_text":null,"title":"Does scikit offer any classifier based on rule induction such as PRISM, CN2, MODLEM, etc?","secure_media_embed":{},"distinguished":null,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","domain":"self.MachineLearning","hide_score":false,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"MachineLearning","created_utc":"1430002498","author_flair_text":null}

It's perfectly obvious. Great scientists have thought through, in a careful way, a number of important problems in their field, and they keep an eye on wondering how to attack them. Let me warn you, `important problem' must be phrased carefully. The three outstanding problems in physics, in a certain sense, were never worked on while I was at Bell Labs. By important I mean guaranteed a Nobel Prize and any sum of money you want to mention. We didn't work on (1) time travel, (2) teleportation, and (3) antigravity. They are not important problems because we do not have an attack. It's not the consequence that makes a problem important, it is that you have a reasonable attack. That is what makes a problem important. When I say that most scientists don't work on important problems, I mean it in that sense. The average scientist, so far as I can make out, spends almost all his time working on problems which he believes will not be important and he also doesn't believe that they will lead to important problems.\u201d\n\nThe whole thing is very much worth reading. Now, of course every researcher considers their work important enough for paying attention to, but there are arguably some problems that are more important than others. What is your take on this?","media":null}

If the pressure sensor is indicated you are at an elevated altitude then you must be upstairs. \n\nSo you get the idea, using the sensors to give you a rough idea of where you phone is in the house.\n\nNow the way to get the highest marks in this project will be to use some clever machine learning. My exposure to ML is very basic I did a module in my first year and well I haven't given it much thought since. \n\nMy question to you folks is, what kind of machine learning should I be looking at implementing to pull something like this off?

I'm not that experienced with OOP and don't really like Java, but I figure I just need to get more used to it.  With regard to math and stats I have deep theoretical knowledge but very little applied because of my university.  So I can explain a ton about mathematical statistics, probability, linear algebra, regression, etc., but have very little experience building models on real data.

What should I be doing this summer if I eventually want a programmer/analyst \"data science\" role once I get my master's?  I was thinking about teaching myself data structures and algorithms in C++, or possibly functional programming (I want to learn some kind of Lisp for the hell of it).  I'm also curious about learning Hadoop or Spark but I don't know where I'd get the kind of computing power I'd need to actually learn them.\n\nRight now I don't have anything lined up for the summer after I applied for a ton of internships and positions, but I might be doing paid research at Carnegie Mellon doing some heavy statistics simulations. (I've had one internship and it was only tangentially related to my field and I was literally the only statistics person there).  If that doesn't pan out, what kinds of things should I spend my summer working on?

I used pylearn2/Theano for a year before switching to Torch7 nine months ago. So why Torch7 vs Theano?\n&gt;\n&gt; Torch7 has lots of documentation. And for neural networks, it has much more than Theano (see https://github.com/torch/nn). If you need to optimize a non-standard piece of code (which is a commonplace requirement for research), then Torch7 is for you. It makes it much easier to code components in C/Cuda.\n&gt;\n&gt; In Theano you have to interface with python's complicated C API hidden in the strings of a huge compiler. Theano is a C/CUDA compiler, which makes it suitable for optimizing a computation graph and performing automatic gradient differentiation. Torch7 on the other hand is not a compiler, so you do not need to think symbolically. This also means that you can code complex computation graphs without needing to wait 5 minutes for it to compile (imagine debugging).\n&gt;\n&gt; Pylearn2 adds stuff to Theano like ready-to-use datasets, higher-level models and unsupervised learning. However, using Pylearn2 isn't easy. Its very different from the mainstream programming you would have learned in school. You always have to think symbolically, but then there are tons of exceptions, which further complicate things. For the year that I used Pylearn2, I loved and got to know it very well. But I eventually got tired of wrestling with the constant changes to the master branch, spending hours going around the code to find how to implement what seemed like a simple extension for my research.\n&gt;\n&gt; I wanted to get back to non-symbolic programming.  It is much easier to navigate and understand. So I switched to Torch7. I haven't stopped contributing to Torch7 ever since. Even working on my own Pylearn2-like alternative: https://github.com/nicholas-leonard/dp (pylearn2 had some good ideas, like datasets, early-stopping, plugins, which Torch7 doesn't provide out of the box), and some experimental CUDA extensions: https://github.com/nicholas-leonard/cunnx.\ufeff\n\nWhat do you think? (Upvote, if you want to see an active discussion -- I earn no karma, as it's a self-post)","permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/3478m1/discussion_theano_vs_torch7/","link_flair_text":null}

Each new topic would be subject to the exact same continuous cycle of collection and transformation.\n\nThus, I need a data store in which to keep and uniquely identify the raw fetch data as well as the subsequent output of the transform agents. It's obvious to me that I could implement this in a relational database, using tables for *topic* and *agent_N*, relying on *topic.topic_id* as a FK in the *agent_N* tables. I could store the agents' output in the corresponding *agent_N* table and so on. I'm just curious if there are any reliable, proven models out there that are better suited to this type of task.\n\nThanks.  \n","retrieved_on":1440762435,"ups":1,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/34fdf1/what_data_storage_models_are_best_suited_to_ml/","link_flair_text":null}

It does not appear a very active area of research (for eg. there is little to no work using the ever popular \"Deep Learning\" for ranking). Is progress difficult because we already have very good performance (I am unable to interpret the goodness of NDCG numbers given in most papers), or because the problem is very difficult (but a lot of scope exists for improvement), or (as I saw in ne of the slides) ML community does not consider ranking as a significant problem ?  \n\nThanks\n","retrieved_on":1440762391,"ups":8,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/34fgrq/question_learning_to_rank_what_is_current_state/","link_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"default","title":"[Question] Learning to Rank - what is current state ?","secure_media_embed":{},"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"MachineLearning","created_utc":"1430418535","author_flair_text":null,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","hide_score":false}
