This is almost never true, but in many situations Naive Bayes works reasonably well despite this.\n\nThe typical solution is to use a [Bayesian network learner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network#Structure_learning) which captures the interdependencies between attributes, but this is far more complicated than Naive Bayes.\n\nI think I've thought of an alternate approach using a technique from economics for removing \"selection bias\" from a dataset.\n\nLet's say we have 4 nominal input attributes, A, B, C, and D, and an output attribute Z.  We don't know the relationships between the input attributes, but they are probably somewhat dependent on each other.\n\nMy proposed approach is to effectively \"filter\" the interdependence out of the input attributes.  How?\n\nLet's take A and B first.  If A and B were independent, then knowledge of A's value would not affect the probabilities of the various values that B might take.\n\nBy looking at the data we can see the impact that A has on B.  For example, we might see that if A is \"dog\", then the likelihood of B being \"house\" is 0.3, but if A is \"cat\", then the likelihood of B being \"house\" is 0.4.\n\nWe can view this as there being a [selection bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias) for the value of B, and economics gives us a well-understood way to remove this bias called [Heckman correction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heckman_correction).\n\nWhile the theory behind it is more complicated, applying this correction is very simple.  We take the probability of B having it's current value given A's current value - P(B|A), and we weight that sample by  1/P(B|A) (setting a maximum weight of, say, 20 - to guard against very small values for P(B|A) screwing things up).\n\n*Note* that these weights only apply when calculating probabilities for the attribute B, so the weight is associated with this specific attribute, not with the entire sample (which is more common).\n\nSo now in our dataset we have weighted our attribute B such that it is independent from A.  Next we want to do the same thing for the attribute C, but in this case we need to weight its samples by the probability that C will have it's value given A **and** B's values, or 1/P(C|A,B).  Since A and our corrected B are now statistically independent, we can safely use a naive bayes classifier with A and B as inputs and C as the out to determine this weight for each sample.\n\nAnd then once we've got weights for all the C attributes, we can repeat this for attribute D, assigning weights to each of its samples using naive bayes with A, B, and C as inputs, and D as the output.\n\nFinally, we can use Naive Bayes to predict our output attribute Z using A, B, C, and D as inputs - and we are now statistically justified in doing so because we know that A, B, C, and D are now independent.  The result, I would hope, would be superior predictive performance.\n\nThis seems a bit too good to be true though, where have I screwed up?\n\n*edit*: Thanks for everyone's feedback.  Certainly there is a question mark over whether this will work (is pairwise independence sufficient?), but since nobody has convinced me that it won't work - I guess I'll just go ahead and implement it, and test it on some datasets.

I think that phenotype-genotype relationship in Evolutionary Algorithms can be improved if phenotypes did not translate literally to genotype. Exploring the solution space might be improved by utilizing epigenetic factors.\n\nI have found quite a bit on epigenetic robotics and there is indeed a paper on ieee called the Epigenetic Algorithm, but I cannot access it. Most of the research on epigenetics seems to focus on using evolutionary algorithms to identify and study epigenetic factors rather than the other way around. \n\nI would really appreciate if somebody could direct me to some papers, or methods, or explain to me what challenges lie ahead.\n\nCheers.\n\n**EDIT: Some update:**\n\n\n\n\nI have read the paper called Epigenetic Algorithm that was published on IEEE thanks to TleilaxuMaster.

The new system identifies a customer by any single one of their in game name, paypal id, IP address, email address and phone number. It's still not perfect but it gives us reasonable accuracy in tracking orders across customers.\n\nWe currently have a blacklisting system which will enable us to retroactively ban scammers from our system, but what I would like to do is implement a scoring system for order risk so we can spot potential scammers *before* we deliver, potentially saving us more money. \n\nI have these numerical data points available:\n\n- Their IP location (latitude and longitude)\n- Their phone location (latitude and longitude)\n- Their paypal location (latitude and longitude)\n- Their IP country as an enumerated value\n- Their phone country as an enumerated value\n- Their paypal country as an enumerated value\n- Their game account level\n- The distances between their IP, phone and paypal locations\n- The number of orders they have placed\n- The average quantity of each order\n- The length of time they have been buying\n- The frequency of their orders (once per day, every other day, etc)\n- The age of their paypal account\n- The number of orders that have failed delivery (if they don't want to verify id, etc)\n- The source of their visit (if they're from a marketing channel like adwords, etc)\n- Whether their paypal account is verified\n- Whether they have verified their email\n- Whether they have verified their phone number\n- Whether they have verified their ID\n- Whether their email address matches a pattern that scammers are known to use (first + last name + number usually)\n\n**I'm confident in my programming abilities to be able to implement an algorithm that would be best for analyzing the data, but where I'm lost is in choosing an algorithm to use.** I'm currently reading [Machine Learning in Action](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1617290181) but I would appreciate any advice that you all can give about a more specific direction to start working. =)\n\nIf you also have suggestions about other data points that would be useful to find and include, I am open to upgrading the order system to support that too.","domain":"self.MachineLearning","num_comments":23,"likes":null,"clicked":false,"thumbnail":"self","saved":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","ups":8,"approved_by":null,"score":6,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr Which is generally a good algorithm to be implemented in python for monitoring fraudulent orders on an ecommerce website?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over the past year I built a small (16,000 transactions by this point) website that trades in mmorpg items, mainly currency.

The original system accounted the customers by simply using their paypal id, but as that id changes between transactions if they pay with credit card, I recently upgraded the system for more thorough tracking. The new system identifies a customer by any single one of their in game name, paypal id, IP address, email address and phone number. It&amp;#39;s still not perfect but it gives us reasonable accuracy in tracking orders across customers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We currently have a blacklisting system which will enable us to retroactively ban scammers from our system, but what I would like to do is implement a scoring system for order risk so we can spot potential scammers &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; we deliver, potentially saving us more money. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have these numerical data points available:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Their IP location (latitude and longitude)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Their phone location (latitude and longitude)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Their paypal location (latitude and longitude)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Their IP country as an enumerated value&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Their phone country as an enumerated value&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Their paypal country as an enumerated value&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Their game account level&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The distances between their IP, phone and paypal locations&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The number of orders they have placed&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The average quantity of each order&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The length of time they have been buying&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The frequency of their orders (once per day, every other day, etc)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The age of their paypal account&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The number of orders that have failed delivery (if they don&amp;#39;t want to verify id, etc)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The source of their visit (if they&amp;#39;re from a marketing channel like adwords, etc)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Whether their paypal account is verified&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Whether they have verified their email&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Whether they have verified their phone number&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Whether they have verified their ID&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Whether their email address matches a pattern that scammers are known to use (first + last name + number usually)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&amp;#39;m confident in my programming abilities to be able to implement an algorithm that would be best for analyzing the data, but where I&amp;#39;m lost is in choosing an algorithm to use.&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#39;m currently reading &lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1617290181\"&gt;Machine Learning in Action&lt;/a&gt; but I would appreciate any advice that you all can give about a more specific direction to start working. =)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you also have suggestions about other data points that would be useful to find and include, I am open to upgrading the order system to support that too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","created":1339705507,"hidden":false,"over_18":false}
