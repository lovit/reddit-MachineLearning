In general, I would regularize this part of the network by applying a small amount of dropout to x, constraining the row-norm of the weight matrix W, and applying a small amount of weight decay to W.  \n\nHowever, I'm not sure that this is still the best strategy if x is very sparse.  Suppose in the most extreme case that x is a single categorical variables with tens of thousands of possible values.  Also it is a practical necessity that the runtime of the training algorithm is proportional to the number of non-zero elements in x rather than the total size of x.  \n\n1.  Dropout on the inputs.  This is a sparse operation if implemented correctly.  However, I am somewhat concerned that it will be too strong and noisy as a regularizer for sparse categorical features (since by definition the values of a sparse categorical feature are not positively correlated, whereas features like adjacent pixels in an image are highly positively correlated).  \n\n2.  Weight constraints.  Neither Computing the row-norm of the weight matrix nor dividing the weights by the norm are sparse operations.  Also, there are a lot of researchers who work on sparse linear models, and I've never seen any of them use weight constraints.  \n\n3.  Weight decay.  If one adds an L1/L2 penalty to the cost term, then the gradients and the update are not sparse.  Alternatively one could have a penalty which only applies when the corresponding x term is non-zero.  \n\nAny ideas / experience on what sorts of methods work well?

This is typical of the difference between data mining and machine learning: in data mining, there is more emphasis on interpretible models, whereas in machine learning, there is more emphasis on accurate models.\n\nBut do you guys see this difference in practice (particularly in academia)? Do people use measures of interestingness rather than straight prediction accuracy? Is time and space complexity less of a concern? Maybe data mining research focuses less on \"Big Data\" and uses more \"medium data\"?

SVM was going nowhere - it degenerated to a constant single class function, while simple linear classifier were doing much better. I decided to remove KMeans for the moment and focus on SVM. Only after normalizing the data (subtract the mean and divide with standard deviation of each feature), did I get meaningfull results.\n\nThis was a bit puzzling to me. As I understand it, SVM with RBF should at the worst of generalizations acts as convoluted a KNearestNeigbours algorithm. The data also had a very well defined range, mostly just pixel on - pixel off.

Find the top 1,400 subreddits by number of users (those subs that have more than 10k subscribers).\n\n    2. for each of those subs, get comments until there is a userbase of 250k redditors\n\n    3. For each subredditor, parse from their profile page all comments and posts they have made.\n\n    4. For each sub among those 1,4K , compute their similarity with the rest using the [Jaccard Similarity coefficient](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index).\n\n    5.Create slick website :)\n\n    6. When a user searches for a redditor, the app checks if that user exists on the database, if not, it pulls the user subs following the logic explained on step 3.\n\n    7.Once the list of all subs that redditor is subscribed to is retrieved, sum the similarities of those subs with every other sub on the database.\n\n    8. Return the top subs based on the total sum of similarities calculated on 7.\n\n\nSome people have suggested that I could get better information about a user by using the Reddit Api. Even though by implementing this method I could get all the subs a user is subscribed to (instead of those the user has commented or posted on), that would retrieve also the default subreddits that user has not unsubscribed from, therefore increasing the noise on the recommendation algorithm.\n\nWhat do you guys think of the implementation?\n","permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/25o2ge/oc_i_made_a_basic_recommendation_engine_for/","link_flair_text":null,"is_self":true,"author":"manueslapera","from":null,"archived":true,"id":"25o2ge","name":"t3_25o2ge","link_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"num_comments":15,"author_flair_css_class":null,"quarantine":false,"edited":false,"score":16,"stickied":false,"from_kind":null,"created":1400199716,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/25o2ge/oc_i_made_a_basic_recommendation_engine_for/","from_id":null}

The columns are:\n\n    position  theta  velocity  angular-velocity force-applied-to-cart value\n\n...Where \"value\" is a simple objective function whose inputs are all taken from the first four columns (x, theta, v, w).  All inputs are scaled such that their mean is 0 and they range more or less within [-3, 3].  The output is scaled such that the mean is 0.5, and all values fall within the interval [0.2, 0.8].  \n\n\nA 5-25-1 feedforward network tasked with learning the value function and trained in Matlab can converge on an almost perfect solution with Levenberg-Marquardt or Scaled Conjugate Gradient descent very quickly.  However, using very similar network architecture in my own code (one difference being that my output neuron is a sigmoid, while Matlab's output neuron is linear) SGD and RMSprop fail to converge to a good answer.  I've tried minibatches with SGD, using the entire dataset per epoch, and lots of different learning rates and learning rate decay values.  I've spent a similar amount of time tweaking hyperparameters with RMSProp.  \n\n\nRISO's LBFGS implementation also fails with this dataset, although I haven't put as much time into playing with it.  \n\n\n\nI see three possibilities:\n\n\n1.)  A bug in my code.  This is of course the thing I've been most suspicious of, but I'm begining to doubt this is the cause.  My code passes [this test](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/Gradient_checking_and_advanced_optimization), and successfully extracts gabor shapes from natural images when used for autoencoding.  It also passes simpler tests, like learning XOR^* .\n\n\n\n2.) Something about this dataset is particularly difficult for stochastic methods.  This seems unlikely; if you put together a scatter plot of value-vs-theta-vs-omega, you can see that it's a rather simple structure.\n\n\n\n3.) SGD and RMSProp are incredibly sensitive to hyperparameter values, or perhaps weight initialization, and I've just been setting them wrong.  Right now I'm initializing weights with a uniform random variable -1&lt;R&lt;1: w = R * sqrt(6/(N+M+2)), where N and M are the incident layer sizes.  I've also tried simply assigning the weights small uniform random numbers.  \n\n\n\nI'm hoping someone can give me some insight into why my SGD and RMSProp are failing here.  This should be an easy problem, but I can't find anything to point to that's demonstrably wrong.  \n\n\n\n\n*: In regards to XOR, my code also seems to be very senstve to hyperparamters when solving this.  A 2-3-1 network needs over 10000 iterations to converge, and won't do so if the batch size is anything other than 1.  Starting froma  configuration that converges, and reducing the learning rate by a decade and also increasing the number of training iterations by a decade does not result in a network that also converges.

If I'm feeling extremely depressed, I can generally just come another day unless we have a big deadline coming.\n\nI'm soon finishing my master and after that, I intend to stay at that job for about 1-3 years to accumulate some money and gain experience. But after, I'd like to change track a bit and go more into the data science / machine learning field rather than biostatistics.

The work is titled,  \"Sharing features between objects and their attributes\" - Hwang, Sha, Grauman CVPR 2011. Here is the link:www.cs.utexas.edu/~grauman/papers/hwang_CVPR2011.pdf. \n\nThe objective function in that work from the perspective of multi-task learning (crudely) is to learn a common set of parameters of a classifier that reduces the classification error rate jointly on all the said tasks. The authors in that work use the SVM as a classifier. The objective function has a collective sparsity regularization term as well, which I understand enforces a so-called joint sparsity structure across the set of \"shared\" classifier parameters. The intuition is that a subspace of parameters is learned that is common to all of the said tasks.\n\nMy question is that, if I were to use a neural network as a classifier with a multi-task objective function, what form would that term that enforces the common sparsity take? How different is it from the usual L2-norm-the weight decay term that is generally employed with neural networks? \n\nAny insights would be appreciated.","retrieved_on":1441347935,"ups":2}

Each row of my database contains : 1) the id of someone 2) some parameters of the environment X (exemple : the temperature, the wind etc.) 3) a binary variable Y representing the person's reaction to the parameters (exemple : get sick or does not get sick because of the weather). My idea (based on intuition and not on data) is that we can gather people in a finite number of groups so that in a group, people have the same reaction to temperature (some are easily sick, others are never sick...). In a given group, more formally, the law of Y conditionnaly to the parameters X is the same.\n\nI have no idea of the law of Y conditionnaly to X. For the parameters X, I can do some hypothesis if necessary.\n\nI would like to create some cluster of people \"having more or less\" the same reaction to parameter. Besides, I would like to predict the reaction of a given person to a given value of the parameters (even if this event has never happened in the database).\n\nIt seems to me that we can treat the problem like a non parametric mixture model. Indeed, as I don't have hypothesis on the conditionnal law of Y, I think I will have to create it with kernels method for instance. I have found this paper : http://biometrics.cse.msu.edu/Publications/Clustering/MallapragadaJinJain_NonparametricMixtureModels_SSSPR10.pdf Besides, it seems to me that, in this case, each row of observation (X_i, Y_i) is not a simple realization of some random variable but X_i is a realization of a random variable and Y_i is a realization of a random variable conditionnaly to X_i. I don't know if it makes a difference.\n\nPrecision : I have around 100.000 rows , the vector X_i has some components discrete and others continue.\n\nSo, I am wondering :\n\n    is my approach correct ?\n    would you advise me another point of view for this problem\n\nI would be very interested in any references about it.\n\nDon't hesitate to make me reformulate the problem statement.\n\nThank you very much in advance.\n"}

Basically, we are looking to perform clustering on a dataset that has heterogeneous feature vectors. For simplicity's sake, imagine the features are \"color\", \"quantity\", and \"pattern\" - a mixture of nominal and ratio values. Furthermore, they can be missing. (As an additional note, we do not know the underlying struture/quantity of the clusters at all - however, they can be verified by a human). \n\nNow, we are aware of some distance function solutions for feature vectors of this type so we have a few different modules that calculate distance functions differently. However, we cannot find many clustering algorithms that are useful to us. Many clustering algorithms seem to rely on being able to find a mean of some collection of feature vectors, which clearly does not mean anything for our data set (what's the mean of 'red' and 'blue', for example). Furthermore, we have the missingness issue to contend with - but that's less of a problem at the moment. \n\nMostly, I was just wondering if anyone could suggest some clustering methods or distance functions that might be well-suited for our problem. I've read quite a lot of papers and two books (not exactly exhausted my resources but I think I've got a good lay of the land) but I'm still sure there must be something fitting for us out there. For full disclosure, my background is CS and physics but I am doing research in a CS department.   \n\nThanks!","domain":"self.MachineLearning","hide_score":false,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"MachineLearning","created_utc":"1401298152","author_flair_text":null,"title":"Clustering heterogeneous data - a question about relevant methods.","secure_media_embed":{},"distinguished":null,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self"}

It gives a nice overview of a number of general lessons that are useful to keep in mind when solving machine learning problems.

This is in a layerwise pretraining frame work, so i wanted to confirm that what this means is that whenever we are learning a layer, half of its units are relu units and the rest are negative relu?\n\n\n2.Also the reconstruction functions seemed to have been problematic for him, and he tries out many methods. One of these is scaling the activations of the hidden layer to 0,1 range and then using sigmoids for the reconstruction.\n\na. How do we normalize the activations in 0 to 1, is it across a minibatch, or is it across the hidden layer?\n\nb. suppose i call my visible layer v, I learn hidden layer 1, h1, and then want to learn the second hidden layer h2.\n\nSo going from v to h1, I use ReLU, but coming down from h2 to h1, I use sigmoid? i.e. the up and down activations of each hidden layer are different?","media":null,"ups":2,"retrieved_on":1441332442}
