Maybe it’s really easy and I’m just missing something. Either way I’d appreciate any pointers anyone can give me. \n\nSuppose you have a classifier that tells with an Area-under-ROC curve of 0.7 if somebody will develop cancer (any kind of cancer). Now I have a second classifier that tells with an AUC of 0.75 if somebody will develop lung cancer (more specific kind of cancer). The classes are obviously related (one more specific than the other). However, the base-rate of the lung cancer is only a third of what the rate of cancer is in the data set and I'm worried that the little bit of extra might not outweigh the raw chance of somebody just getting cancer. How do I test if my second, more specific classifier picks up on cases that the first one would have missed? To be more specific, how great is my benefit, if any, of using the second classifier in addition to the first one?

This is why I&amp;#39;m posting some ML conferences here in case some of you may not know about them.  This list is by no means complete, it&amp;#39;s just my personal pick of the &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; conferences to follow if you&amp;#39;re interested in ML.  So, here goes (I&amp;#39;m too lazy to actually put links):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;ICML&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;NIPS&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;UAI&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;AISTATS&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;COLT&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;ACL, NAACL, EMNLP (they have pretty strong machine learning tracks)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other, less ML related, but still possibly interesting conferences (by possibly interesting I mean that they get the odd ML paper that can be very interesting):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;KDD&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;ICDM&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;SIGIR&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;VLDB&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;COGSCI&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","created":1300967589,"hidden":false,"over_18":false}
