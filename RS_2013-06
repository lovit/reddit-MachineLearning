Unfortunately the journal in question is behind a paywall so it&amp;#39;s difficult to distribute, however I can provide an alternative (free) paper that deals with essentially the same equation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2FBF00992697.pdf\"&gt;As far as I can tell equation (1) is extremely similar to the function in question, or at the very least contains the portion I am confused about&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(from now on anything in {} is considered subscript)\nThe part I&amp;#39;m having trouble understanding is: (P{t+1} - P{t}) How is P{t+1} calculated exactly? My assumption is that P{t} is the output of the state at the current time (i.e. before the action is taken) and P{t+1} is the output of what the next time-step would be if the weights were to stay the same (i.e. the action is taken, then the resulting state is fed as the input to the network and P{t+1} is the resulting output) Is my assumption correct?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve read both Journals (the actual journal I&amp;#39;m talking about is: &lt;a href=\"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2298811\"&gt;http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2298811&lt;/a&gt; and the formulas are (5) and (6) in case some of you have access to journals through academic facilities etc.) and I&amp;#39;ve read through the TD (and several other) sections in: &lt;a href=\"http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/%7Esutton/book/ebook/the-book.html\"&gt;http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/book/ebook/the-book.html&lt;/a&gt; however it seems none of them actually explain how the prediction for {t+1} is calculated (and I assume it&amp;#39;s probably common knowledge among RL circles hence their not explaining it).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any help would be greatly appreciated, and if this is in the wrong sub I am deeply sorry.
