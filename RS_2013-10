I'm taking the same course as the OP of that post and am stuck in the same spot.\n\nA recap of the task I'm trying to perform (as I understand it) is: Generate N+4 2D points. Pick 2 points at random and remove them from the pool. Use the line these 2 points form to label all other points as + or - depending on if they fall above (+) or below (-) the line. Pick another 2 points. Use this line as the hypothesis function for determining if a point in the pool should be + or -. Use the PLA to update the hypothesis until it is correct.\n\nI've been able to do everything except the last line. I'm starting out with an N of 10. I generate 14 points, remove 2 and use that line to label the other 12. I remove another 2 and have my hypothesis function. I loop over the other 10 points, determine its actual label, then I multiply the x element of the point by the x weight and the y element of the point by the y weight (the weights are initialized to 1, so this does nothing at first). I feed this weighted point into my hypothesis function and get the guessed sign. If it matches the actual sign, I continue on. If not, I update the x weight as so: weight_x = weight_x + (desired_sign * original_unweighted_input_x). I update the y weight in the same fashion. Then I loop through all the inputs again using the new weights until my hypothesis matches the actual for every input. This usually ends up looping forever and never converging.

I'm trying to run randomForest to predict survivorship with multiple predictors, but I keep getting this error - (Type of predictors in new data do not match that of the training data.)  I get that a \"Survivors\" column does not exist in my test dataset, but that is what I need to figure out.  So how can I run this test without a Survivors column that I am not provided?  \nhttp://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted\n\n\n#library(Amelia)\n#missmap(train, main = \"Missingness Map Train\")\n#missmap(test, main = \"Missingness Map Test\")\n\ntrainData=train\ntestData=test\nhead(trainData)\nhead(testData)\nnames(trainData)\nnames(testData)\n\ntrainData=trainData[c(-1,-4,-6,-9,-11)]\ntestData=testData[c(-1,-3,-5,-8,-10)]\n\nnames(trainData)\nnames(testData)\nstr(trainData)\nstr(testData)\n\nas.factor(trainData$Survived)\n\n#Generate randomForest learning trees\n#library(randomForest)\n\ntrain_rf=randomForest(Survived~.,data=trainData,ntree=100,proximity=TRUE)\ntable(predict(train_rf),trainData$Survived)\nprint(train_rf)\n\nplot(train_rf)\nimportance(train_rf)\nvarImpPlot(train_rf)\n\n#Test the built random forest for Test Data\n#Type of predictors in new data do not match that of the training data.\ntrainPred=predict(train_rf,newdata=testData)#[,-1])\ntable(trainPred,testData$Survived)\nplot(margin(train_rf,testData$Survived))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

A player&amp;#39;s height won&amp;#39;t change much between two years, so I can tell that two records aren&amp;#39;t the same player if the heights are very different, and a defensive lineman isn&amp;#39;t likely to have many passing yards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m wondering if this is even a machine learning problem, since many such problems are about simplifying and pattern matching (e.g. given that same data, figure out what can identify the positions played - taking the 1600 player data and clustering into about 17 positions, and given some new data, predict the position).  In this problem the data is very shallow, so there&amp;#39;s not much to actually train and test on - I&amp;#39;m trying to match 1600 records to another 1600 records.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not asking anyone to solve this problem for me, but if anyone can tell me what kind of problem this is so I can research it further, that would be great.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","mod_reports":[],"distinguished":null,"report_reasons":null,"downs":0,"edited":false,"thumbnail":"self","num_comments":18,"id":"1or8mx","user_reports":[],"over_18":false,"secure_media_embed":{},"media_embed":{},"gilded":0,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/1or8mx/what_type_of_analysis_is_this_matching_two_lists/","score":8,"domain":"self.MachineLearning"}
