I found some papers describing how using function approximation with Q learning can lead to over-estimation of the Q values. Indeed, I noticed that when I changed the reward function, it would typically either not decay from the highest Q values or do so very slowly. To remedy this, I tried force-decaying Q values over time upon state visitation, but this didn't really help.\n\nSo after that, I attempted getting a more exact function approximation. I tried using radial basis function networks instead of the plain old feed-forward neural networks. Results here are promising, I immediately noticed a reduction in temporal difference error values (which would indicate it predicting properly more often). As far as I know, radial basis function networks often have their prototypes/centers pre-trained using K-means clustering. However, since I am developing an entirely online algorithm, I had to adapt it to work continuously. To do so, I implemented a sort of competitive unsupervised learning strategy that mirrors an online form of K-means clustering. I tested it on some benchmark supervised learning tasks, and I got much faster learning rates than with feed-forward neural networks (I was able to consistently learn an XOR in 30 updates).\n\nI also began taking a deeper look into policy gradient methods, since these are supposedly less affected by inaccuracies in function approximation. I may end up using a natural policy gradient method.\n\nOn the HTM front, I only did some tuning of parameters. I am actually quite pleasantly surprised by how well it works, with all the scrutiny it is under I expected worse. It produces stable patterns (same state gives same pattern, with some generalization allowed) for my function approximators. We will soon see how well it scales up though ;)\n\nHere is a video of it predicting the motion of a box. It is a bit old, I made it when I first got it working, but I thought I should share it anyways. The left side is input, the right side is output. When the left is blue, it is the \"true\" input, when it is red, it is the distributed representation.\n\nLink: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0s2NXuw9H8&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0s2NXuw9H8&amp;feature=youtu.be)\n\nThat's it for this update, progress is being made, slowly but surely!\n\nEdit: Here is a link to the source code. The repository containts many agents, the one these posts are focusing on is called HTMRL and can be found in the directory of the same name!

However, I have found that using SARSA instead of Q learning (on-policy instead of off-policy) mitigates the problem a lot since it is no longer bootstrapping on the largest potential value (subject to overestimation) but rather the potential value of the selected action.\n\nDue to this improvement, I decided to move back to feed-forward neural networks with RMS training. The RBF networks train much faster, but they seem to forget things faster (things not part of the replay chain). I assume this is due to the on-line supervised learning that occurs, which can destroy previously learned information quite easily in favor of better matching new information.\n\nI now have HTMRL performing both pole balancing and the mountain car problem with very little training time. It figures both of them out in under a minute usually.\n\nI started scaling up to the Arcade Learning Environment, and did some short test runs. I also did a lot of optimization, since I want it to run in real-time (Deepmind's algorithm was not in real-time as far as I know, and took more than just one standard desktop PC). I have not yet trained it enough to get decent results (5 minutes is not much), but I will probably try an overnight run soon.\n\nFor the continuous action edition of the algorithm, I experimented with free-energy based reinforcement learning. It learns a value function as usual, but it can easily derive a continuous policy from the value function. I started implementing replay updates for this as well.\n\nHere is a short video of the system learning the mountain car problem: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMdgakMZxyE&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMdgakMZxyE&amp;feature=youtu.be)\n\nFor those just seeing this for the first time, the source code for this is available here, under the directory \"htmrl\": [https://github.com/222464/AILib](https://github.com/222464/AILib)\nIt uses the CMake build system.\n\nIt's getting there!\n\nSee you next time!","permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/2i8i0e/my_attempt_at_outperforming_deepminds_atari/","link_flair_text":null,"title":"My Attempt at Outperforming Deepmind's Atari Results: UPDATE 4","secure_media_embed":{},"distinguished":null,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","domain":"self.MachineLearning","hide_score":false,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"MachineLearning","created_utc":"1412380587","author_flair_text":null}

This matrix is sparse, as entries are calculated only for friend pairs.\n\nNow, I want to predict the possible similarity scores between non-friend pairs i.e fill the empty values in the matrix.\n\nI read about [**latent factor models**](http://www.ideal.ece.utexas.edu/seminar/LatentFactorModels.pdf) and the use of SVD to minimise the squared reconstruction error.\n\nBut there are a few differences with my use case. I need to perform svd on a user-user matrix, not a user-item matrix. This would mean that I need my result to be of the form A= U U^T , where U is the latent factor matrix for a user. This does not seem to map to SVD, but to Cholesky decomposition. Using Cholesky decomposition does not let me choose the number of latent factors.\n\nI am not sure if I am thinking in the right direction or if there is some fundamental flaw in my approach.

{"ups":9,"retrieved_on":1441137309,"selftext":"Hey everybody!\n\nAnother update!\n\nThe reinforcement learning portion is done, so now I turn my attention to the image recognition portion so that I may scale up better to the ALE. I originally tried to go immediately to the ALE, but it takes so long to find out whether or not what you did is working so instead I decided to stay with pole balancing. However, instead of feeding values such as position and velocities of the cart directly to the HTM bottom-most region, I am now using an encoding of the image of the experiment. This provides me with an intermediate step on the path to scaling up to the ALE.\n\nAt this point, I could dump the HTM stuff and just do ConvNets, but that feels like a cop out. I have found an interesting paper that compares CLA (HTM) to the state of the art, and they showed that it indeed outperforms things like convolutional neural networks (they used LeNet), mostly due to the time signal, on tasks where sequences of information are presented. I have such a task. So, I will continue working on my HTM implementation and improving it. I am currently in the process of reading that paper (available here: [http://bias.csr.unibo.it/maltoni/HTM_TR_v1.0.pdf](http://bias.csr.unibo.it/maltoni/HTM_TR_v1.0.pdf)) to see how they were able to adapt it for classification (from which I can adapt it to function approximation).\n\nI am still not quite certain if I am encoding the greyscale images properly for the HTM, right now the regions are way too stable. The previously mentioned paper talks of feedback signals from higher regions in the hierarchy that allow for adaptation of lower levels with the context gathered from the higher levels. My current HTM model does not have this, so I am very interested in seeing how that affects things for reinforcement learning.\n\nRight after this post, I will continue reading the paper, and start coding a new HTM model. Besides incorporating any improvements I can gather from the paper, I am moving everything to the GPU using OpenCL. I used to be mainly a graphics developer, so this shouldn't take too long to do :)\n\nFor those just seeing this for the first time, the source code for this is available here, under the directory \"htmrl\": [https://github.com/222464/AILib](https://github.com/222464/AILib) It uses the CMake build system.\n\nThat's it for this update, until next time!","media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/2iecbn/my_attempt_at_outperforming_deepminds_atari/","secure_media_embed":{},"title":"My Attempt at Outperforming Deepmind's Atari Results - UPDATE 5","thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"distinguished":null,"hide_score":false,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1412551797","subreddit":"MachineLearning","media_embed":{},"score":9,"edited":false,"quarantine":false,"stickied":false,"from_id":null,"from_kind":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","created":1412555397,"secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/2iecbn/my_attempt_at_outperforming_deepminds_atari/","is_self":true,"from":null,"author":"CireNeikual","link_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"name":"t3_2iecbn","id":"2iecbn","archived":true,"num_comments":4,"author_flair_css_class":null,"over_18":false,"saved":false}

First of all, a warning. I am trying to understand this stuff for fun and without sufficient background to understand *serious* textbooks, so stupid questions ahead. I basically know what I know by reading and trying to understand random threads on this subreddit.\n\nSay I have an audio effect and I don't know how it works. It is a function of the current input sample and possibly older input samples (a simple example would be a soft clipper, which maps any input sample to the range [-1, 1] and depends only on the current input sample, and a complex one may be \"playing a sound trough my speakers and recording it with a cheap microphone from under the desk\", which will depend on a lot of old input samples).\n\nI was thinking of generating a very long audio signal, which contains a lot of different audio material (music, drums, vocals, noise, sinusoids, and so on), and passing it trough the effect to produce the output signal. Then I would make a neural network learn this function.\n\n***Questions*** in no particular order.\n\n\n1. Am I just wasting time or does it make some kind of sense to try this? Since I have never really done any machine learning it would be nice to know in advance if it's not working because it cannot work (easily). :p\n2. What learning algorithm should I use? I think I should use SGD by choosing random points in the audio signals at each iteration.\n3. What kind of neural network should I use? I am confused a lot on this one. I don't think I understand exactly how a convolutional network works, but If I'm not completely wrong they do not have anything to do with what I'm trying to do and I should use a fully connected MLP.\n4.

Deepmind did not have a separate feature extractor and reinforcement learner. They used a convolutional neural network to predict Q values for discrete actions. While I have both a discrete and continuous version of HTMRL, I really want to focus on the continuous version since it can be applied to more problems in the future. However, the way I am currently obtaining a continuous policy from a Q function makes it far more efficient to separate the structures for image feature extraction and reinforcement learning instead of combining them.\n\nI fixed several large bugs in my HTM implementation that were causing it to predict poorly. In case this HTM stuff doesn't work out though, I tested a convolutional restricted boltzmann machine network on the pole balancing problem.  In case I do end up pursuing this route instead of HTM, I would need to handle partial observability in the reinforcement learning portion of the algorithm.\n\nIn HTMRL, partial observability is handled by the HTM itself: It produces novel patterns that combine both current state and predicted future state. A problem I am currently having with it though is that unless I make the receptive field of the HTM columns very small, it will not perceive small changes in the image. It will instead just ignore them. It is possible to remedy this by adding more and more columns, but this drastically slows down the algorithm. Therefore I am currently experimenting with different parameters and topologies to find what works best. If I absolutely cannot get it to work, I still have that Conv-RBM.\n\nIn case I do end up using Conv-RBM instead, I would need to handle partial observability differently. Fortunately though, I was already able to solve problems such as the T-maze problem by simply feeding the hidden units used by the free-energy based reinforcement learner back to the visible units. To be honest, I didn't expect such a simple solution to work, but it worked. So, unlike Deepmind's algorithm, I now can learn \"infinitely\" long-term dependencies (theoretically anyways). Deepmind used a fixed-size history window as far as a know, which both increases the complexity of the resulting MDP and cannot account for long-term dependencies that require knowledge beyond this time window.\n\nIn case you missed it, the free-energy based reinforcement learner (FERL) I use for the continuous version of HTMRL is derived from this: [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3584292/](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3584292/). I modified it heavily to perform both continuous actions and handle partial observability.\n\nSo, to summarize: HTM, or Conv-RBM + recurrent hidden nodes in the reinforcement learner portion. I will probably end up doing both ;)\n\nFor those just seeing this for the first time, the source code for this is available here, under the directories \"htmrl\" and \"convrl\": [https://github.com/222464/AILib](https://github.com/222464/AILib) It uses the CMake build system.\n\nUntil next time!","id":"2iqdsg","archived":true,"name":"t3_2iqdsg","link_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":1,"is_self":true,"author":"CireNeikual","from":null,"stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","from_kind":null,"created":1412833479,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/2iqdsg/my_attempt_at_outperforming_deepminds_atari/","secure_media":null,"from_id":null,"quarantine":false,"score":29,"edited":false}

For the moment I've tried several things:\n\n* different vectorizers: CountVectorizer (count occurences) or TfidfVectorizer (compute the tfidf)\n* different tokenizers: unigrams, bigrams, trigrams\n* various algorithms: SVM, Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naives Bayes, Random Forest.\n* cascade of classifiers using the hierarchy in the data.\n\nI can't get past 0.57 in accuracy rate (SVM with L1 norm by training on 500k documents) with those parameters... I'm always around 0.5 with those different configurations. And it doesn't really improve after 100k documents.\n\nI'm trying to do some error analysis. I've computed a confusion matrix only with top-labels (test file size = 2k docs, algorithm = SVM):\n\n* top-label : (precision recall f1-score support)\n* TL1 0.57 0.25 0.35 16\n* TL2 0.00 0.00 0.00 1\n* TL3 0.57 0.55 0.56 258\n* TL4 0.61 0.47 0.53 277\n* TL5 0.46 0.41 0.43 27\n* TL6 0.61 0.37 0.46 38\n* TL7 0.69 0.31 0.43 35\n* TL8 0.84 0.84 0.84 130\n* TL9 0.50 0.06 0.11 31\n* TL10 0.71 0.63 0.67 111\n* TL11 0.64 0.34 0.45 143\n* TL12 0.73 0.93 0.82 815\n* TL13 1.00 0.17 0.29 12\n* TL14 0.72 0.72 0.72 32\n* TL15 0.47 0.14 0.22 56\n* TL16 0.51 0.88 0.65 81\n* TL17 0.80 0.86 0.83 14\n* avg / total 0.67 0.68 0.65 2077\n\nAs you can see, one top-label creates a lot of confusion. It is the top-label \"product\" (TL12) which as you can imagine is really frequent in the context file (about 50% of the corpus). Some other top-labels that are also semantically related confuse each other a lot.\n\nAlso, when I'm checking the documents that were not classified well, I realize that the classifier often gets it wrong even though a very particular word is appearing in the document such as 'satisfied client' and 'thank you' in a document that should have been classified as 'congratulations, thanks'. I don't really understand why.

I'm somewhat familiar with SVMs as they apply to numerical data, but not to tokens.\n\nSo I've been attempting to use http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_extraction.html#feature-hashing to help me.\n\nIt seems this will automatically take some feature dictionary and convert it into a matrix useable in SVM by taking each feature and hashing it to produce some index that the feature is associated with.\n\nThis sounds perfect for my project, however it's not clear how I will use it.  I've created an SVM and trained it on a small number of feature vectors created from some words using feature hashing.  However, when I try to predict the class of a feature vector produced from a token that wasn't in the original training set, the SVM throws an error.\n\nIt seems that the feature hasher produces a different sized vector (at least last time I tried this).  Maybe I did it wrong, but correct me: if the SVM is trained on a certain dimension feature vector, then all feature vectors that are to be predicted must be the same dimension.  Perhaps there is just an issue with my code, I'll post an example in a bit...  Or maybe I'm completely misunderstanding how feature hashing works?\n\nedit: Also maybe I shouldn't be using an SVM at all?  If not, perhaps you can recommend me something? There are roughly 32 features for each token/word and 30 of them are binary features, the last two are the part of speech and the actual token.","media":null}

But i never implemented gradient descent because my data was fitted perfectly fine with the OLS solution for weight vector.\n\nI am extremely confused how to create a weight vector for Logistic regression, I understand that it requires use of Gradient Descent because there is no closed form solution. I also read about the Newton method for calculating the weights but I don't understand it at all.\n\nAnd after you use these methods to calculate weights how do you apply the weights to the sample data? In Linear regression it was simply because you simply multiplied the weights by the features (and higher order features for higher order linear regression), but is it the same in logistic regression?\n\nMoreover my understanding so far is that this model only works for binary classification, so how would i do it for three classes?\n\nBasically my question boils down to this:\n\nHow exactly do you find the weight vector for logistic regression (using either gradient descent or newtons method, whichever is easier) and how do you apply the weight vector to the sample to get a classification out of it for 3 classes (not just two).","media":null,"ups":1,"retrieved_on":1441122186,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/2ja7zo/i_am_having_trouble_understanding_and/","from":null,"author":"TrashQuestion","is_self":true,"num_comments":3,"author_flair_css_class":null,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"name":"t3_2ja7zo","link_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"id":"2ja7zo","archived":true,"score":1,"edited":1413343382,"quarantine":false,"from_id":null,"created":1413346292,"from_kind":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/2ja7zo/i_am_having_trouble_understanding_and/","secure_media":null,"stickied":false}

When the estimator uses the guess weights and happens to classify it as 1 or 0 correctly (matched with the true class), the error is zero which means newWeightVector equals oldWeightVector and the difference becomes zero. How do i avoid this? Its obvious that my guess the correct weight distribution.\n\n  [1]: http://pastebin.com/wdq3KyGf","id":"2jecze","archived":true,"gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t3_2jecze","saved":false,"over_18":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":16,"is_self":true,"author":"[deleted]","from":null,"stickied":false,"secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/2jecze/why_is_my_gradient_descent_algorithm_stopping_so/","from_kind":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","created":1413447549,"from_id":null,"quarantine":false,"edited":1413479210,"score":0}

{"ups":3,"retrieved_on":1441114960,"selftext":"Writing my bachelor's thesis, I noticed that I had several problems with my workflow:\n\n1. Keeping a journal and analyze one's test results is difficult. Doing so and in the meantime running several other tests, knowing which tests are comparable to which is even more difficult. Especially when one's software is regularly changing to meet new needs.\n2. Succeeding in getting the same test scores today as I got two months ago is surprisingly hard.\n\nI have been doing some thinking about what is missing, and maybe what I want is a program which allows me to say: \"I have a bunch of experiment results right here, and I believe they were retrieved some time in May. My automatically generated log book seems to confirm that such a result was created on May 18. Please recreate the state of the program as it was back then, and rerun the program with the same parameters as I used in that experiment.\"\n\nEssentially, an experiment log book that also stores the commit IDs of the current state of the experimental framework (and in the case where the scientist doesn't use VCS, one could automatically be set up for them). This would potentially solve the second problem, and be the ground work for the solving the first problem, which perhaps could be summarized as \"Evernote for the scientist\".\n\nMy question to you is mainly the one asked in the title, but also whether you have had the same problem yourself, and how you came to solve it.

In the seventies, someone might ask \u201cwhat are the goals of AI?\u201d And you might say, \u201cOh, we want a computer who can beat a chess master, or who can understand actual language speech, or who can search a whole database very quickly.\u201d We do all that now, like face recognition. All these things that we thought were AI, we can do them. But once you do them, you don\u2019t think of them as AI. It has this connotation of some mysterious magical component to it, but when you actually solve one of these problems, you don\u2019t solve it using magic, you solve it using clever mathematics. It\u2019s no longer magical. It becomes science, and then you don\u2019t think of it as AI anymore. It\u2019s amazing how you can speak into your phone and ask for the nearest Thai restaurant, and it will find it. This would have been called AI, but we don\u2019t think about it like that anymore. So I think, almost by definition, we will never have AI because we\u2019ll never achieve the goals of AI or cease to be caught up with it.\n\n\nSource:\n[Terence Tao Interview](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rinL25rC8LnMTzZcGjg1axT-0r-oiCnoKKH1DLQlmVA)\n\n\n[Terence Tao (wiki)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Tao)","media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/2jv2o7/terence_taos_philosophical_take_on_strong_ai/","is_self":true,"from":null,"author":"Guoguodi","name":"t3_2jv2o7","link_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"archived":true,"id":"2jv2o7","author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":4,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"edited":false,"score":13,"quarantine":false,"stickied":false,"from_id":null,"secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/2jv2o7/terence_taos_philosophical_take_on_strong_ai/","subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","created":1413872824,"from_kind":null}

(250,000 observations, 2 groups, 30 independent variables)\n\nI'm working on a linear discriminant analysis model using R-Studio and the MASS and klaR package.\n\nThe steps I took:\n1) Loaded the data\n\n2) Ran the lda function on Class against the 30 independent variables\n(noticed a warning that some of the independent variables are collinear)\n\nsteps 3 onwards is where I have issues understanding what I'm doing/ whether I think i'm doing it right.\n\n3) I searched for a model selection technique to trim down the amount of independent variables for LDA. The function I thought which would've helped was \"stepclass\" from \"klaR\". \n\nDescription of stepclass function: \"Forward/backward variable selection for classification using any specified classification function and selecting by estimated classification performance measure from ucpm.\"\n\n\nThis was the code i used\n\nldaselect &lt;- stepclass(Label~DER_mass_MMC+DER_mass_transverse_met_lep+DER_mass_vis+\n                         DER_pt_h+DER_deltaeta_jet_jet+DER_mass_jet_jet+DER_prodeta_jet_jet+\n                         DER_deltar_tau_lep+DER_pt_tot+DER_sum_pt+DER_pt_ratio_lep_tau+\n                         DER_met_phi_centrality+DER_lep_eta_centrality+PRI_tau_pt+\n                         PRI_tau_eta+PRI_tau_phi+PRI_lep_pt+PRI_lep_eta+PRI_lep_phi+\n                         PRI_met+PRI_met_phi+PRI_met_sumet+PRI_jet_num+PRI_jet_leading_pt+\n                         PRI_jet_leading_eta+PRI_jet_leading_phi+PRI_jet_subleading_pt+\n                         PRI_jet_subleading_eta+PRI_jet_subleading_phi+\n                         PRI_jet_all_pt, data=cdata, criterion =\"AS\", method=\"lda\")\n\n\nI figured the criterion should be AS (ability to separate) since LDA seeks to find the variables which create the greatest separation between groups.\n\nHowever, after running forward, backward, both direction selection, it only returns one variable, \"PRI_tau_pt\" as the only necessary independent variable.\n\nI'm just skeptical of the result, and I was hoping if anyone here could give me some advice, or let me know if I've chosen the wrong steps (or if model selection is even necessary for LDA)\n\nRegards,\nMarvin","retrieved_on":1441112178,"ups":1,"subreddit":"MachineLearning","media_embed":{},"author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1413881344","hide_score":false,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","distinguished":null,"thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"Question regarding model selection for linear discriminant analysis models","subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","from_kind":null,"created":1413884944,"secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/2jveoh/question_regarding_model_selection_for_linear/","from_id":null,"stickied":false,"quarantine":false,"score":1,"edited":1413881638,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":1,"id":"2jveoh","archived":true,"link_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t3_2jveoh","gilded":0,"author":"07crisma","from":null,"is_self":true}

In the latter, we use sampling tecniques to find the state x(t) given observatio up to time t, i.e. we want to find p(x(t)|y(1:t)). We use sampling techqniques because we don't know, for example, the normalizing constant of the bayes formula. For example, in the formulation P(A|B)=P(B|A)P(A)/P(B), I've read that typically we cannot compute P(B), which involves an integral.

Here's what I'm looking to do -- I have scraped text data from a large sample of websites, essentially domain names like abc.com, pqr.org, rsv.net etc. I expect to have text data from many million such websites, and in the future I hope to expand this dataset to include data from the Common Crawl Project.\n\nMy task is to identify \"high growth\" potential websites from this data. I.e. i want to be able to identify potential startups in this sample and throw out personal websites, websites for SMEs, news websites, blogs etc. \n\nI have a few questions:\n1. Am i right in thinking that this is a standard classification ML problem? what algorithms should I be looking at? Will I be alright using something like python's scikit-learn?\n\n2. How would this task change if I wanted to classify websites into more types, say by industry (travel, holiday, finance etc).\n\n3.

That reason being that if two points are mutually nearest neighbors (they are closer to each other than to any other point), then they should belong to the same cluster.  I realize that most algorithms are trying to minimize the intra-cluster distance and there is no requirement that two mutually nearest neighbors fall into the same cluster.

The most accurate predictor of this, would require a rule system which encodes your entire brain and its functions, and the entire environment that you interact with, including other people, and the laws of physics.  In fact, to be as accurate as possible it would have to simulate the entire world.  What if you turn on the news and you see a fire is near your house, and then you drive away?  Well if you had included the wheather patterns and simulated forests and the likelyhood of forest fires you would have been more likely to predict the pattern of movement.\n\nSo this would require ridiculously massive amount of computation.\n\nSo, when something that seems as simple as your gps coordinates turns out to require computing an whole world, how accurate can machine learning possibly be for many things?  Maybe this explains why stuff like facial recognition is so difficult.  Because to calculate the likelyhood of a face, you have to be able to take an image and take the 2 dimensional pixels and convert it to a 3d surface, which in order to solve correctly would require advanced knowledge of how our world works, including even the type of camera used, the exact location of the camera in 3d space relative to the face, and probably the genetics of how human heads are shaped, including ethnicity, skin tone, ect.  Its a ridiculously complicated problem, so to think that a machine learning algorithm will figure all that out is insane.","media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/2ka3n7/thought_experiment/"}

I use a different technique based on HTM (hierarchical temporal memory), but both Deepmind's technique and my technique fall under reinforcement learning.\n\nSo recently I posted about the HTM-RL architecture I was going to use. In it I decided to use a multi-layer perceptron to learn Q values from the outputs of HTM regions. In order for this to work, I realized that I would have to end up using an experience replay mechanism, much like Deepmind did.\n\nSince I find experience replay inelegant, I wanted another approach to solve the problem of \"catastrophic forgetting\". Normally if you try to train a multilayer perceptron in an online fashion, newer values tend to destroy previous ones. Experience replay solves this to some extent by performing stochastic gradient descent on a window of past samples. This works well, but the memory requirements are enormous if you extend your replay window.\n\nSo I decided to take a hint from HTM, and I developed a new supervised online learning algorithm that does not suffer from catastrophic forgetting. It uses SDRs (sparse distributed representations) to represent its input in a field of nodes. Then, the output is simply a linear combination of the SDR that was formed. This makes it a universal function approximator, but at the same time the spatial pooling (input pattern generalization) greatly reduces catastrophic forgetting by reducing the strength of a backpropagation update depending on the output of the SDR cells.\n\nI ran a simple experiment: I trained this \"SDR-net\" to learn a sine function of its input, by giving it all the samples in order. I then did the same with a MLP. When incrementing the X value by 0.001 at a time and trying to learn the corresponding Y value, the SDR-net got 270 times less error within 20PI!\n\nBut don't take my word for it! Source code can be found in my AI experimentation library, \"AILib\". It is named SDRRBFNetwork in the \"rbf\" directory. Link: [https://github.com/222464/AILib/tree/master/Source](https://github.com/222464/AILib/tree/master/Source)\n\nThis algorithm has quite possibly already been discovered.
