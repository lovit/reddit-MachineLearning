I have a bunch of data (taken from reddit actually) and the attributes are things like title, author, permalink, and a classier that is a text based (e.g. 'popular_post').\n\nThe problem I'm having is that Weka automatically assigns all the text based attributes (e.g. title) to the nominal type.  What I want is to:\n\n1) be able to convert things like the title to string without changing the types of other attributes. So far, selecting an attribute form the explorer, selecting the \"Nominal to String\" filter and applying that doesn't work unless I remove all the other attributes.\n\n2) After turning the title into a string I want to turn the string into a vector so all my posts will have entries for each of the words in the dictionary.\n\nExample data I have:\n\n    post_id ||  title               ||   author ||   subreddit   ||    score     || model_type\n\n\n    001            cats rule!            joe1          /r/awww         9001     popular\n\n\n    002            guns rule!           bob1         /r/guns             0             doa_post\n\n\nWhat I'd like to end up with\n\n\n\n    post_id ||  cats || guns || rule ||  author ||   subreddit   ||    score     || model_type\n\n\n    001           1           0         1        joe1          /r/awww        9001       popular\n\n\n    002            0          1         1        bob1         /r/guns         0             doa_post\n\n\n\nAny help would be appreciated!","downs":0,"created_utc":1359667643,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/17nima/weka_helped_needed_preprocessing_multiple_types/","retrieved_on":1413141467,"link_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"banned_by":null,"title":"Weka helped needed: preprocessing multiple types of data","subreddit":"MachineLearning","author_flair_text":null,"link_flair_css_class":null,"score":0,"gilded":0,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me try to explain this simply.
