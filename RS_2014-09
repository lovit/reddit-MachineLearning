I think I probably don't have what it takes at the moment to achieve that, so I'm willing to devote some time to improve (I have savings for up to a couple years of self-study). BTW my interests skew more towards applications like computer vision, medical/geophysics imaging etc. (as oposed to pure stats/ML research), but i want to approach those problems from a ML perspective (a'la \"Computer Vision\" by Prince). \n\nI have a Bsc+Msc in CS from a technical university in Poland (it's one of the best in the country, sadly doesn't really have major cred outside). I am familiar with the ML field - my Msc thesis was in AI and ML, and I've worked for 2 years in a startup where I implemented ML-based products. I am aware that my knowledge of ML is mostly limited to that of a practitioner's and I most likely lack in some of the fundamentals required to do math-heavy research.\n\nThis brings me to my question - which subject to self-study and at what depth? I'm inclined to just go through everything obviously relevant (calculus, linear algebra, probability, statistics, machine learning) at a fairly deep level, working through \"harder\" textbooks (I'm currently plowing through Spivak's Calculus) and gaining solid mathematical foundations. However, I'm wondering if that's the smartest course of action - i.e. if this will even be enough to get me into a solid program - or, alternatively, if I could get in without going through some of the material (or by studying from less in-depth textbooks for now) and fill in the gaps by taking courses during first years of study.

(i understand that if i'll set the previous centers it would save a lot of iterations of the algorithm, but if there is a way or maybe another algorithm to also pass the iteration over the old profiles it would be great)\n\n\nthank you so much again,\nLiran","retrieved_on":1441187193,"ups":0,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"num_comments":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"id":"2fggmy","archived":true,"gilded":0,"name":"t3_2fggmy","link_flair_css_class":null,"author":"liranreg","from":null,"is_self":true,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","created":1409844990,"from_kind":null,"secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/2fggmy/kmeans/","from_id":null,"stickied":false,"quarantine":false,"score":0,"edited":false}

[For details click here](http://ag1le.blogspot.com/2014/09/morse-learning-machine-challenge.html)\n\nThe goal of this competition is to build a machine that learns how to decode audio files containing Morse code. I hope to attract people  who are interested in solving new, difficult challenges using their predictive data modeling, computer science and machine learning expertise.\n\nDuring the competition, the participants build a learning system capable of decoding Morse code. To that end, they get development data consisting of 200 .WAV audio files containing short sequences of randomized Morse code. The data labels are provided for a training set so the participants can self-evaluate their systems. To evaluate their progress and compare themselves with others, they can submit their prediction results on-line to get immediate feedback. A real-time Kaggle leaderboard shows participants their current standing based on their validation set predictions.\n\nI have also provided  sample Python Morse decoder  to make it easier to get started. While this software is purely experimental version it has some features of the FLDIGI Morse decoder  but implemented using Python instead of C++.\n\nPlease help me to spread this message to attract participants for the Morse Learning Machine challenge!\n\nThe link to the challenge is [here!](https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/morse-challenge)\n\n73 \nMauri AG1LE","media":null,"hide_score":false,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1409872121","subreddit":"MachineLearning","media_embed":{},"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"Morse Learning Machine challenge","thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"distinguished":null,"stickied":false,"from_id":null,"from_kind":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","created":1409875721,"secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/2fi18j/morse_learning_machine_challenge/","score":7,"edited":false,"quarantine":false,"gilded":0,"name":"t3_2fi18j","link_flair_css_class":null,"archived":true,"id":"2fi18j","author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":13,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"is_self":true,"from":null,"author":"ag1le"}

Now as the title states I was wondering if it is possible to use machine learning to make a program that can make programs?\n\nYou might be wondering why would someone want to do this, well the idea is perhaps if you could somehow be able to give it some direction of what you want it to make, say you could direct it to make AI. Which having a computer do the job it might be able to code faster than a human although probably not as intelligently though. See with machine learning doing it perhaps it would seem to have some 'intelligence' instead of just piecing together random pieces of code till it makes something.\n\nI've looked into genetic programming but the one problem I've discovered is the fact you need to have a fitness function which comes across to me as a sort of answer to the question. So basically you need to know the 'answer' before it can make anything. With AGI or AI I don't see how you would know what the answer would be.\n\nI was also wondering about the cuDNN and it's suitability to this idea as I just recently got a GTX 770 4GB model which would hopefully be perfect for using with it. Or the other idea was a Python machine learning setup as I actually just learnt Python (well Python 3.x) so it is fresh in my mind. Also hoping there would be an easy to setup version for testing at first as if it requires too much cs knowledge and mathematics knowledge I will be stumped.\n\nAny replies will be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks.","media":null,"ups":3,"retrieved_on":1441181471,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/2fshij/is_it_possible_to_use_machine_learning_to_make_a/","downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","distinguished":null,"title":"Is it possible to use machine learning to make a program that can program?","secure_media_embed":{},"created_utc":"1410163457","author_flair_text":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"MachineLearning","domain":"self.MachineLearning","hide_score":false}

The output specification would be a one-hot encoding, so it would have 12 dimensions, but the output layer would *not* have a softmax activation (because of my test case described below).\n\nIf I train the network using audio signals of single, individual notes, would it be able to separate out the notes of a chord played at test time? For example, assuming the network does a great job at determining the note being played when a single note is presented (i.e. great training performance), if the network was presented with an audio signal of a chord (F, A, and C, for example), would it be able to output a 1 for the F tone, the A tone, and the C tone?\n\nI realize that all of this could be accomplished by playing around with the audio signal in frequency domain, but I was just curious if a neural network was able to do something like this.

We had the conceptual technology (e.g. least squares) to fit polynomials in the 1800s, too. There are a lot of similar theorems for othogonal functions on L2 spaces, wavelets, Fourier series, etc. A mixture of normals can approximate any density. These theorems are everywhere.

Does anybody have any experience with tools that implement clustering algorithms in faster languages? The specific algorithm that I've found useful for my problem is affinity propagation, but I'm willing to look at other things.\n\n\nEdit: I'd just like to thank everybody again for their input, this has been really stimulating for me, not just in thinking about this particular problem but thinking about all of the tools I use.","media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/2g026c/clustering_tools_in_languages_that_are_faster/","secure_media_embed":{},"title":"Clustering tools in languages that are faster than Python?","thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"distinguished":null,"hide_score":false,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1410353958","subreddit":"MachineLearning","media_embed":{}}

I don't feel I have a deep enough fundamental understanding to fully participate in those reading groups. I personally would also like to go through the Elements with other people since I'm not entirely confident in my own abilities and I hear Elements is a great starting point. \n\nSo far I have two other people on reddit, /u/CreativePunch and /u/rianahmamy, and one friend in real life who have expressed interest in a reading group on this. \n\nMy general idea for the reading group would be structured similar to class in my mind. Perhaps assign a chapter to read every week[negotiable depending on chapter length &amp; difficulty]. Then have some subset of example problems to work through on your own and each week we would get together on perhaps a google hang out or similar free meeting website and discuss/compare answers. \n\nI've never attempted this before but I'm thinking might as well give it a shot. If we get low number probably up 10 people or so, we can probably keep it one group. Much more than that it would probably be one group with more flexible attendance or perhaps separate smaller groups. \n\n\nI feel like I'm rambling a bit, but TL;DR is if you're interested let me know! Hopefully we can start in the next week or two and work through the text in the coming months. \n\nEDIT:\nPost Time zone too! \n\nEDIT 2: Wow! A lot more interest than I was expecting! I know that many of you have posted time zones here, I'm going to send out a survey to everyone to get a rough idea for everyone's availability. Since we seem to be at least in the 30+ range of participants I'm wondering what the next move is in terms of organization. Should we move to our own subreddit? Either to a defunct  one or create our own, or perhaps google groups? \n\nEither way, I'm heading into work soon so I won't be able to do too much in the next 8-9 hour range. I'll PM everyone some details or post them here in the next day or two so watch your inboxes!\n\n\n\nEDITTTTTTTTT:\n\n\n\nWow, so this thing continues to grow, and frankly has been a little bit overwhelming but very exciting too. So following the advice of some other redditors and figuring that we might as well start getting the ball rolling I created.... (cue drumroll, dim lights)...... /r/eosl !!!!! (yayyyyy)\n\nBut really right now it is very rough because I just woke up and created it. But it exists. So everyone should subscribe there and we'll start making moves. I'll do my best to try and get the subreddit up and running smoother this weekend but I have a lot of family time slotted for this weekend so I may not get a chance to update it until sunday evening est. In the mean time for those of you who have not yet started reading, I'll post the link to the book and perhaps this week will be Preface/Intro/Chapter 1 general discussion. \n\n\nWe'll read chapter 1 this week but mainly focus moving forward. Maybe, we can also discuss this in r/eosl since that is a thing now. \n\nEither way, really crazy to see this much support!","media":null,"ups":30,"retrieved_on":1441175509,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/2g59c9/elements_of_statistical_learning_reading_group/"}

I need to come up with a generative model for these (for automatic anomaly detection). Each sensor is identical, so generative process for the data can be assumed to be the same.\n\nAs a first pass, I averaged out each component of the series, to come up with a mean time series. Autocorrelation over the elements of this mean series shows clear first order dynamics, and an ARMA model fits quite well.\n\nHowever, I am worried that this is the best way to model this kind of data, since each sensor is deployed in its own environment and the standard deviation of each component of the mean series is significant. So, a model trained on the mean might miss outlier events in individual series.\n\nI wonder if there is any guidance on how to approach this kind of problem?  \nThanks for any pointers!","permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/2gl54w/modelling_the_dynamics_of_many_independent_time/","link_flair_text":null}

Remaining images go in the *X* set.\n\n2) Permute *X* and *Y* so that for each target of the subject in the set *Y* will be used as target for each entry in *X*. So if *X* has 20 images for *subject1* and *Y* has 5 images of *subject1* this means that the final training set would have 100 entries, 5 for each entry in *X*, for each subject.\n\n3) Use a deep network in order to learn a facial representation for each subject that approximates all the targets for that subject with the least error. Thus acquiring (hopefully) an \"average\" of each of the subject's images in *Y*. (with optionally some extra constraints such as penalizing asymmetry\n\nNow I do realize this is probably not very optimal, especially when it comes to approximating the average representation using 5 different targets for each entry in *X*, and using MSE will probably not do very well in this case.\n\nSo my question is: Has there been any research on this? Is there a better error measure, or method I could use?\n\n**Note:** I am not looking to do sample reduction either.

I have a little bit of machine learning experience but am in no way an expert.  One of the interesting tools I see is GridSearchCV so I don't have to manually try different combinations and permutations of parameters.\n\nSo following [this](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/grid_search_digits.html#example-grid-search-digits-py) as a tutorial and guide I can see how to implement the function.  What I am curious is how do you know within what ranges do you try values for the different parameters.\n\nFor example if I am trying to train C in my SVM we can look at the [SVC documents](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVC.html#sklearn.svm.SVC)\n\nBut all it says is:\n\n&gt; C : float, optional (default=1.0)\n \n&gt; Penalty parameter C of the error term.\n\nSo I have no idea if I should be trying positive numbers, negative numbers, in [0.0, 1.0], if I should be trying 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, etc or if I should be going larger in trying 9, 99, 999, 9999.\n\nObviously I could enter in all those different numbers in the parmeter value of GridSearchCV (but there are literally infinite) so I am wondering if there is a more intuitive way to find the realistic ranges of values to try for different parameters?

I'm a quick study though, but I don't always know where to begin or how deep I'm going to have to go with a project.\n\nWhat we have: Our library transactions (check-outs, renewals, as well as research questions and also the book catalog and customer database) are tracked in a MySQL database (via a library-specific product). We have some functions on our website that use PHP to pull stuff from the database, and I'm reasonably competent at manipulating that. We also use Crystal Reports to do some basic stats and reporting.\n\nWhat I want to do: customer profiling, discovery of trends, and other basic data analytics and data mining. \n\n\"Big data\" is of course the buzzword going around, but from my reading it seems clear that what we really need is just basic analytics. I've tried doing some research to find a product or service or platform that could be useful. I don\u2019t have much of a budget, though if I prove that I can get some useful stuff going then I might get some budget  next year.\n\nSo what I\u2019m looking for here is advice about which product or service (if any) I should be looking into. Any advice is appreciated!!\n\nThe options I\u2019m looking at:\n\n* http://ubiq.co/ - surprisingly cheap web based reporting for MySQL\n* http://infinidb.co/ - would use the open source version, but might have to learn Hadoop? Also might be too \u201cbig data\u201d for my needs\n* https://spark.apache.org \u2013 supposed to be an easier alternative to Hadoop (I\u2019m 90% sure our server runs on Apache \u2013 not sure if that\u2019s relevant)\n* http://www.cloudera.com/ - seems like a bigger deal than I need at this time\n* Learn to use http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Hive on top of Hadoop\n* Just get way better at Crystal Reports\n* Just use PowerPivot in Excel (after taking a course in it because I suck at basic pivot tables)\n*  http://watsonanalytics.com/ - sounds like it might be exactly my speed \u2013 any experience with it?\n\n**TLDR** \u2013 Idiot noob wants data analytics on MySQL.

My question for you is, why did you choose to pursue a Masters or PhD in ML?\n\nMy dream job involves doing something with ML, or working on difficult computational problems. The last thing I want to do is be a generic application developer for a big company. But unfortunately that is the only job I've been able to find.\n\nI am faced with the following decision, accept a job as a software consultant making 70k salary and hope that I can eventually move to a more interesting job after a few years experience, or I can apply for masters/phd programs in ML and then look for work again when I finish. I would really love to work for Amazon or Facebook or another big company that does a lot of ML work. Would it be easier to get there with a Masters or with 2-3 years experience doing software consulting?\n\nI am sure some of you have been in my situation before, what did you do?

The forty dimensions can be reduced (using symmetry and other conserved quantities) to roughly 21 parameters (some of which are periodic), and the internal correlations are known very well and are non-linear.\n\nOver the course of the last few months, we (with the help of a nice global compute network) have spent nearly 350 CPU-years to evaluate this function on the order of 2.2 billion times. Which gives us an average run time of just over 5 seconds per evaluation.\n\nIn the coming years, we will need to scale up that 2.2 billion number by orders of magnitude, and I don't believe our compute network will scale at that rate, so we need to come up with a solution. \n\nMy idea was to use the 2.2 billion samples we already have to train some ML regression technique to approximate this function under the Universal approximation theorem. Evaluating the NN should take orders of magnitude less time per sample than a 5 second function, and information lost due to the approximation should be recoverable using a separate technique I recently developed (unique to this problem domain).\n\nInitially, I applied my own implementation of a kNN regression technique which got modest results and definitely showed that there was something to be gained, but the approximation was too rough for \"prime time\" ... so I need to step it up. I am leaning toward using a SGD Regressor but I don't have a handy C++ implementation in the package I am currently using. (Suggestions welcome)\n\nSo, any suggestions for where to start? Or more importantly, avenues to avoid? I am probably more interested in a discussion regarding ML-based performance optimizations as I am familiar with some ML techniques but am certainly not a dedicated Data Scientist. \n\n(Thanks in advance for your time and patience.)","media":null,"ups":6,"retrieved_on":1441158678,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/2h52g4/mlregression_based_numerical_function/"}

Thus expect some oddities below if you have a reasonable level of expertise. Information below is fairly sparse but some of you may still have thoughts that might point me in the right direction.\n\nI have been working on a fruit picking project.  One of the challenges to this project has been developing an imaging system that can determine what is fruit and what is not fruit. At a glance it seems fairly easy. I really only need to identify one thing- being weather a pixel in an image is fruit and do this for all pixels in an image. Fruit does seem obvious by colour on the tree. However after working for some time on the problem I still have not achieved a reliability level that is in my mind high enough. It is important to keep in mind a *very* high reliability level is required for commercial feasibility. It is \u201cclose\u201d but not quiet there yet and thus I am hoping for some advise from people who might be interested.\n\nSo far it seems Identifying fruit is fairly challenging in the sense that:\n\n1. Real world imaging can be noisy.  White balance is not always consistent. Camera dynamic range is limited and over exposure(heavily effects colour of the region) and sun flairs  are common. Lighting is not controlled so strong shadows are evident.\n\n2. Fruit is regularly obstructed by leaves. It has little shape and little structure. Camera resolution is not high enough to detect the very subtle texture on the fruit that would make it easier to identify. That said I can readily identify what is fruit from the image myself so there should be enough data in the image.\n\n3. I can see that if I change an image to black and white then even for myself it is not obvious which parts are fruit are which parts are leaves. Yes unobstructed fruit is obvious but much that has partial leaf cover is not obvious and easily mistaken. Thus colour is certainly important but has limited dependability.\n\n4. The system must run in real time(preferably 50ms or less per frame) and its done on a per pixel basis.\n\n\nCurrently I am using a self developed hardware accelerated convolutional neural network. Thanks to some prior experience in hardware acceleration it runs fairly fast and thanks to the repetitive structure of convolution neural networks it is repeated very efficiently across an entire image.\n\nI have methods for training it in mini batches via back propagation with momentum, rprop and rmsprop as per obvious literature suggestions. So far I have not implemented dropout(had it in early version but got lost in some optimisations). Activation functions include sigmoids, tanh and RELU units.  Typical structures I try are 5 to 8 layers deep. Map sample size is 5x5 as I cant see much point making it larger due to the lack of structure in fruit obstructed by leaves(wrong maybe- to small?). With some variability I am now trying 90+ maps per layer as lower counts seemed to get to a certain level of reliability but still mis detect some leaves as fruit(for example) in cases where I would expect it to do better. Thus currently I have 10 to 30million connections and about 200k of unique weights used to determine if a pixel is fruit or not(if my serviette calculation is not wrong). To be this seems significant, as if it should be enough, specifically given the lack of structure but perhaps I am wrong?\n\nSomething I notice is that error levels during training initially drop very fast. I guess its probably locking onto colour and simple gradients but then the error rate starts to fall very slowly. Slowly in terms of days training for small gains.  So far I dont seem to be over learning but still stuck with under learning.  Training wise I am using a radeon R9 280 and its all running 32bit floats which should give an indication of processing power being used.\n\nOne query I have is with regards to what you train too. Literature suggest train to non linear portions of the activation function. How about RELU? For 0 do you train to 0 ,or some variable above or below. For the low side so far I suspect slightly above 0 is best to reduce units from dropping out due to never being activated.  What about secondary non linearities in the target. Do you train such to an exact target value or to a value that is above or below the given target(so far I am trying both) for example in the non linear case if target is 1, and output is 1.5 and then I dont feeback an error as that to me is good, its above the target.I would however feedback that error if it were below 1.  A similar thing is done for the \u201coff\u201d case? Thoughts?\n\nOtherwise I have also started to look into odd areas that might help like considering other options other than simply adding inputs before the activation function.  One that appeals to me from work in another field is something like a numerical or of inputs. Instead of for example Sig(A1+A2) you have Sig(A1+A2-A1*A2,..gets more complicated for more inputs..).  It is interesting to me because at different magnitudes its acts differently(ie much less than 1 it is more like just A1+A2 for example and near 1 it acts more like an \u201cor\u201d, above 1 more like xor). I suspect that the xor nature when inputs get large might be useful for forcing input maps to be more unique and more orthogonal(ie force faster convergence on something that might resemble an auto encoder) but am still working on the maths.  Has there been any significant academic investigation into such concepts that anyone can point out?\n\nFor me the obvious area would be do you think the structure is appropriate?  Otherwise any thoughts are welcome. Perhaps I am just not training long enough? Thoughts?","archived":true,"id":"2hb7v6","name":"t3_2hb7v6","gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"num_comments":8,"author_flair_css_class":null,"is_self":true,"author":"automater","from":null,"stickied":false,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/2hb7v6/convolutional_neural_network_query_and_advise/","secure_media":null,"from_kind":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","created":1411548478,"from_id":null,"quarantine":false,"edited":false,"score":5}

I started by experimenting with various numbers of HTM layers and sizes such that the last layer (the input to the actor/critic) was of an appropriate size that was small enough to run fast and large enough to convey enough information.\n\nSecondly, I stopped using vanilla stochastic gradient descent for the actor/critic and started using RMSProp, just like in the original DeepMind paper. It was a simple change but quickly gave me better performance.\n\nThirdly, I started experimenting with ways to convert the binary information outputted by the last HTM region for the actor/critic into a floating-point representation that preserves information but does not hurt generalization at the same time. Originally I did a straight up binary to floating point value conversion, but this makes similar HTM configurations result in vastly different outputs, which greatly hurts generalization. So, instead I then opted for the lossy but generalizing approach: to sum the inputs and divide by the maximum count. This doesn't take all the positional information of the input into account, but with a small enough condensing radius it can provide a decent compression/loss tradeoff.\n\nFourth, I played with some advantage learning replacements for standard Q learning. Advantage learning functions better then standard Q learning in continuous environments, since it amplifies the differences in state-action value between the successive timesteps more.

{"media":null,"selftext":"Hello again!\n\nI am now (almost) satisfied with the performance of the system on pole balancing. The main issue I am having right now is with the function approximators for the actor/critic. They are slow and lack enough precision. Fortunately though, the switch to advantage(lambda) learning helped remedy the inaccuracy in the function approximation to some extent. I need massive Tau values to get decent performance, so increasing the accuracy of the function approximators is a top priority.\n\nAside from that, I worked on the generalization capabilities of the function approximators. I added regularization and early stopping. I also started using a combination of epsilon-greedy and softmax action selection.\n\nI also experimented with using separate function approximators for each action (for the discrete action version). The intuition behind this is that this will reduce error interference and make it easier to learn the larger differences in outputs that result from advantage learning.\n\nI added plotting capabilities using [sfml-plot](https://github.com/bechu/sfml-plot), allowing me to better observe what effects my changes have.\n\nHere is an image of the pole balancing experiment with plotting: [http://i1218.photobucket.com/albums/dd401/222464/polebalancingimage.png](http://i1218.photobucket.com/albums/dd401/222464/polebalancingimage.png)\n\nUntil next time!","retrieved_on":1441148557,"ups":37,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/2hqda8/my_attempt_at_outperforming_deepminds_atari/","link_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"My Attempt at Outperforming Deepmind's Atari Results - UPDATE 2","subreddit":"MachineLearning","media_embed":{},"author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1411941028","hide_score":false,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","quarantine":false,"edited":false,"score":37,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","from_kind":null,"created":1411944628,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/2hqda8/my_attempt_at_outperforming_deepminds_atari/","secure_media":null,"from_id":null,"stickied":false,"author":"CireNeikual","from":null,"is_self":true,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":4,"id":"2hqda8","archived":true,"gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t3_2hqda8"}

I'm sure that's relevant, but I'm not sure exactly how.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf my alphabet set becomes larger (not just 26 letters, say 26000 letters), then the second representation still stays 6 dimensional, while the first one become crazy large.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo my questions are:  \n1. Is there something fundamentally wrong with the second representation?  \n2. What could possibly go wrong when training a classifier?  \n3. Is there any situation where the second representation would be favored over the first representation?\n","media":null,"ups":2,"retrieved_on":1441145143,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/2hxk2x/binary_feature_vector_vs_integer_feature_vector/"}
