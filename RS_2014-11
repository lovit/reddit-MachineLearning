Different loss functions tell me different models are better. In particular I get a 2-5% better ROC-AUC loss if I go with model 1 over model 2.  However, I get a 7 to 20% better Log loss if I go with model 2 over model 1.  The RMSE is 1% better for model 2.  I realize log-loss and rmse are \"well calibrated\", however because the data is so imbalanced, I am concerned that these loss functions will be more impacted by noise in the data.  Also, I do care to some degree about how well the predictions are ordered (another reason to favor AUC).\n\n2. I am not sure I am doing Log and RMSE loss calculations correctly.  Because the data is severely imbalanced (the ratio of positives to negatives is about 1 to 1000), the data i work with is pre-filtered before I get it to remove 99 out of every 100 negative training instances (and I can't get the removed instances later). During training time, I give all instances equal weight, but when I calculate model losses during cross validation, I give negative instances a compensatory weight of 100 and positive instances a weight of 1. My concern is that this weighting scheme is wrong for a number of reasons.  For one I am concerned it will encourage overfitting to the few negative examples that didn't get removed by downsampling.  Second, I worry that it only makes sense to evaluate a model on a test data set that uses the same weighting scheme as the training data.  \n\nAny thoughts and advice would be greatly Appreciated.\nAlex","media":null,"ups":4,"retrieved_on":1441091573,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/2l301k/what_is_the_best_loss_function_to_use_when/","from":null,"author":"AlexTHawk","is_self":true,"num_comments":5,"author_flair_css_class":null,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"name":"t3_2l301k","gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"id":"2l301k","archived":true,"score":4,"edited":false,"quarantine":false,"from_id":null,"created":1414953537,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","from_kind":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/2l301k/what_is_the_best_loss_function_to_use_when/","secure_media":null,"stickied":false}

Today our society lives a moment full (in a good sense) of fast changes and convulsive advances related with technology. Other times in the History, these types of technological changes affected to our daily live and some professional jobs, like when calculators and computer softwares substituted calculists, accountants or draftsmen some years ago. In some sense the Mankind appears to be replaceable by machines in many fields, but I do not pose this question in a luddist sense, because I think that if machines can do better that job, they should do it instead of us and it will be better for all.\nThis question is because I thought a few weeks ago that Mathematic could be relatively safe from all these futurible changes in society and that the job of mathematicians would be one of those which could be saved, like other artistic and creative jobs like writer, poet or, maybe, philosopher. But my thoughts changed suddenly a few days ago and I become depressed because I hoped that pure Mathematic belongs to those disciplines which would constitute the last redoubt of Mankind-necessity, although helped by computers and calculators. However, my latest readings on the last advances on Information Theory, Automata Theory, Computability Theory, Computational Complexity Theory, Theoretical Computer Science, Theory of Computation and Logic have shown me the possibility of a Mathematic done only by computers working syntactically or even semantically with axioms and models in first-order or higher-order predicative, deductive or modal logics developed. I thought, like many other mathematicians, that this almost Hilbertian statement could not be achieved because of G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems, but this asseveration which seems to save Mathematic from a full computerization it's not true because these theorems are true in the first-order axiomatization of arithmetics (Peano) which is not complete, but some (if not all) the second-order or higher-order axiomatizations of arithmetics are complete and these theorems do not apply and, although our computers nowadays only are advanced in first-order automatic deduction, nothing impedes the existence of future computers, which could work in higher-order logics or exotic axiomatizations, solve the most important open problems in Mathematic and prove theorems which Mankind never could imagine; and, in this case, what would be the role of human mathematicians? In fact, would they have any role? Can we save Mathematic for humans? Is there any theoretical or technical impediment which avoids this terrible final? If not, How could we help the machines in do Mathematic? What is, finally, the last role of Mankind in developing Mathematic?\nI'm not searching only in terms of time of computation or deduction. I do not care if a computer takes longer than human being to prove a theorem or to solve a problem, but if it can do all things that we do or even more. If we can save Mathematic for Mankind, what have us that computers have not and vice versa?\nI will accept and thank all transversally or not philosophical or mathematical answers and opinions but well reasoned and founded. I repeat this is not a luddist question or manifestation.","permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/2lee31/what_is_the_future_of_mathematic_and/","link_flair_text":null,"is_self":true,"author":"Gaussiez","from":null,"archived":true,"id":"2lee31","gilded":0,"name":"t3_2lee31","link_flair_css_class":null,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":2,"quarantine":false,"edited":false,"score":0,"stickied":false,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/2lee31/what_is_the_future_of_mathematic_and/","secure_media":null,"created":1415218341,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","from_kind":null,"from_id":null}

I've cross posted this on the Kaggle forums as well, so we'll see if that helps.\n\nConceptually, here's what I think I have to do\n1) Split the training csv into two files using a random 70/30 split, ideally a different split for each training run\n2) Use a generator to yield the lines in the resulting files for one-by-one encoding\n3) Use another generator to feed the output of the previous generator into sklearn for training / xvalidation.\n4) Use another dual generator setup on the test data set to write out predictions\n\nIs there a Pythonic way to handle this problem at scale? Does this put me outside the realm of sklearn and into hand rolled model implementations?

Highlights include:\n\n- Since CUDArray imitates NumPy, its user interface is well-known to NumPy-programmers.\n- CUDArray has CPU fall-back when no GPU is available.\n- CUDArray relies on cuBLAS, cuRAND and cuDNN for fast array operations.\n- deeppy has a pythonic user interface (that is, no YAML configuration files).\n- In terms of speed, CUDArray/deeppy is very competitive with other popular neural network frameworks. At least, that's my experience so far.\n\nBe sure to check out some deeppy examples:\n\n[Multi-layer perceptron with dropout on MNIST](http://github.com/andersbll/deeppy/blob/master/examples/mlp_dropout_mnist.py)\n\n[Convnet on CIFAR-10](http://github.com/andersbll/deeppy/blob/master/examples/convnet_cifar.py)","media":null}

I got a fairly good result of 85% accuracy but I felt this wasn't high enough and had an idea to just come up with my own simple formula.\n\nMy formula has a list of good keywords and bad keywords, and each keyword has a weighted number value. So if the word **movie** is on a web page it has a high number value of 5 and if a negative word appears like **medical** it has a negative number value of -5. \n\nAll the values are added up and if it is a positive number it's a web page about movies, negative number would mean it is not related to movies. \n\nThis may seem over simplified but I tested this on over 300,000 web pages and got a 99% accuracy rate, it basically destroyed the naive bayes on actual data.

I interned at the company this previous summer and most of the work involved writing SQL queries and doing visualizations in Tableau. My manager told me that if I came back I would have room to do more interesting/more complicated things than what I worked on this summer. Some more background on me is that I'm studying Statistics and Computer Science in School and am currently taking the grad level ML course offered at my college. \n\nNow while I am studying statistics and computer science, I feel like I still do not know enough about ML as I would like, and I would like to really practice ML in industry in the future. So my question is where do I go from here? Its too late to apply to grad school at this point as I have already signed an offer, and have never made getting into graduate school the focus of my undergraduate years. Ideally I would like to work in industry implementing ML algorithms in useful ways that have an impact for the business or the customer. I feel like I need to know more though, despite the fact that I have studied both statistics and comp sci. What would be some practical steps for me to take? I've always figured I could learn more ML on my own and participate in Kaggle competitions to build up my credentials, which would then let me transition into a more formal ML role, is that possible? I guess maybe my question boils down to do I need to at some point go to grad school? I'm not against it, but would rather learn on my own and make it that way, is that feasible?","retrieved_on":1441075439,"ups":2,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/2m127c/seeking_advice_on_possible_next_steps_in_working/","link_flair_text":null,"author":"hyperion_agent3011","from":null,"is_self":true,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":6,"id":"2m127c","archived":true,"gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t3_2m127c","quarantine":false,"edited":false,"score":2,"created":1415757090,"from_kind":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/2m127c/seeking_advice_on_possible_next_steps_in_working/","secure_media":null,"from_id":null,"stickied":false}

Essentially I'm trying to code a facial \"verification\" system. Typically face recognition models use 1:N matching which means;\n\n- We have a set of N identities\n- Given image, which identity is represented in the image?\n\nI'm trying to do a 1:1 verification system, which works like this:\n\n- We have one identity\n- Given image, does this image depict the identity?\n\nYou can see that the first system *assumes* a match occurs and tries to pin it down to the correct person, whereas the second system is checking *if* a match exists.\n\nThe difficulty is this -- ML does not work very well for this problem. Typically a classification algorithm uses training data which attempts to describe the difference between classes (e.g. this information represents THIS class, that information represents THAT class, etc), and this is analogous to the 1:N face recognition task. Face verification, on the other hand, only uses a training set with one individual class (there's no class split to discern) and attempts to \"learn\" to identify that class, but since it doesn't have contrasting information it's not very good at doing that. \n\nMy question is this: **what kinds of techniques, if any, exist for identification instead of classification?** If I can't find any good techniques my tentative idea is to mask the 1:1 verification as a 1:N matching problem (so essentially I'll just get a bunch of random face images and collectively describe them as the \"other class\"), but this requires a very large data set that I don't currently have, so I'd like to avoid that option if possible.","media":null,"ups":1,"retrieved_on":1441066316}

My approach has been to add every feature under the sun (dropout, momentum, adaptive learning, regularization, GPU, etc...).  I've been using/testing it primarily on a Kaggle competition where there is a relatively small amount of labelled data (15k).\n\nSo far things work quite well for standard training but I've never successfully trained a network using dropout.  With the latter I either get:\n\n1 - Stuck at around 60-70% training/validation error.\n\n2 - Numerical instabilities (NaN's)\n\n3 - Stuck in a bias-dominated regime.\n\nBy (3) I mean the network will always select a particular output (from a softmax layer) for all validation cases.  The actual choice of output will change each epoch but the network somehow gets stuck being dominated by bias.\n\nI've tried a whole bunch of things:\n\n- Increase learning rate: leads either to (2) or (3).  this happens already at smallish rates like 0.5.\n- Reclu or channelout layers: problem happens for both\n- Momentum: usually makes things worse\n- Fan-in regulator: makes some weights vanishingly small (1e-100) and tends to lead to bias domination (but avoids numerical instabilities)\n- L2 regulator: doesn't do too much.\n- Adaptive per-weights learning rate: tends to lead to more numerical instabilities.  this really speeds up normal learning but with dropout it seems to exacerbate (2) and (3).\n- Random amount of dropout: between e.g. 0.3-0.5 still gives all the same problems.\n\nI realize that the best thing to do would probably be to retreat to a more standard dataset like MNIST (which I will probably do) but the thing is that without dropout I can acheive 80% accuracy on the validation set (and 100% on the training set) so its clear that there's enough data to do better.\n\nTo give more details I'm using a relatively large network (4-5 layers of size 200 with inputs of size ~50 and output ~10) using either Reclu or channelout and without any pretraining.  \n\nI refresh the choice of dropout units every minibatch (size 10-150) and I also do 0.2 dropout on the input layer.\n\nI do intend to go back to MNIST and compare to some published results but if anyone can provide some thoughts or inspirations I would really appreciate it!\n","media":null,"ups":6,"retrieved_on":1441065819}

The problem is, someone can be riding in a car and they still need to be able to text.\n\n  One difference between the scenario of a driver texting vs a passenger texting is that the driver is likely not typing as they normally do while not driving.  In particular the timing information between keystrokes could be used to detect one-handed typing which is characteristic of texting while driving.  The phone screen could then be made to go blank until the phone's GPS shows that it has stopped.

One of the sensors is the variable of interest (subcool, a temperature difference), 6 of the sensors relate to variables that can be changed by an operator in order to keep the variable of interest in control (steam, choke, gas rates), and the rest of the sensors monitor the environment (temperatures, pressures). The goal is to better predict and control the variable of interest. The time lag between the changing of operator controlled variables and the variable of interest can vary depending on the state of the environment. The time to action right now is usually hourly, and an out of control event could take a day or two to be brought back in control.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions for how to attack this as a machine learning problem? What kind of preprocessing will I need to do?

If my network is learning perfectly the training set but not the test set, could it mean that it actually **lacks** the power to represent the actual complex function? This behaviour seems to happen even when I have a single hidden layer with 30 hidden units.\n\n2. Do I actually need a GPU to be able to experiment with these things?
