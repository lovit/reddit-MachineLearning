The form asks the evaluator to rate the student on 14 items (such as expressing empathy or addressing the client's concerns adequately).  Each of these items can be graded as a + (if the student says something that reflects appropriate use of that item, for ex. if the student appropriately expresses empathy), or a - (if the student says something that reflects inappropriate use of that item).

First of all I clarify some points. We have two similarity matrices which contain same set of items for which we gather information from two different sources.\n\nYou can assume that similarity matrices contain pairwise closeness of two people. These closeness values come from two different sources such as Facebook and MySpace.\n\nLet's give you an example to illustrate what I want to say.\n\nWe have 4 people: John, Paul, George, Ringo. All they have Facebook and MySpace accounts.\n\nFrom their Facebook profiles, we made some processing and somehow we evaluated the closeness of these people as follows.\n\n* Paul - John = 0.5\n* Paul - George = 0.4\n* Paul - Ringo = 0.6\n* John - George = 0.6\n* John - Ringo = 0.5\n* George - Ringo = 0.6\n\nFrom MySpace,\n\n* Paul - John = 0.2\n* Paul - George = 0.3\n* Paul - Ringo = 0.4\n* John - George = 0.2\n* John - Ringo = 0.1\n* George - Ringo = 0.15\n\nFrom informations above, we can easily create two matrices both of which are symmetric with respect to the main diagonal. Our ultimate goal is to calculate how similar these two matrices are.\n\n1- What if I align all those values (of course only one triangular for each matrix) in one row (like below) and simply evaluate Pearson Correlation Coefficient between\nthese rows?\n\n* facebook = [0.5, 0.4, 0.6, 0.6, 0.5, 0.6]\n* myspace  = [0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1, 0.15]\n\nYou may have noticed that these similarities are **not independent** of each other.

How much data is needed before a dataset is considered &amp;quot;large&amp;quot;, for example?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, would you need to take into consideration the number of parameters that each item has, as well as possibly the statistical properties of each of those parameters?  If you have 100 parameters, but 99 of them are either too spaced out or too close together (so they&amp;#39;re effectively useless in classification), would you consider the dataset to be small?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks a lot for your help!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","created":1333118397,"hidden":false,"over_18":false}
