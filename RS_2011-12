This article deserves to be read.**\n\nEurisko, The Computer With A Mind Of Its Own\n\nGeorge Johnson\n\nOn the July 4 weekend of 1981, while many Americans were preoccupied with barbecues or fireworks displays, players of an immensely complex, futuristic war game called Traveller gathered in San Mateo, California, to pick a national champion. Guided by hundreds of pages of design rules and equipment specifications, players calculate how to build a fleet of ships that will defeat all enemies without exceeding an imaginary defense budget of one trillion credits.\n\nTo design just one vessel, some fifty factors must be taken into account: how thick to make the armor, how much fuel to carry, what type of weapons, engines, and computer guidance system to use. Each decision is a tradeoff: a powerful engine will make a ship faster, but it might require carrying more fuel; increased armor provides protection but adds weight and reduces maneuverability.\n\nSince a fleet may have as many as 100 ships—exactly how many is one more question to decide—the number of ways that variables can be juxtaposed is overwhelming, even for a digital computer. Mechanically generating and testing every possible fleet configuration might, of course, eventually produce a winner, but most of the computer’s time would be spent blindly considering designs that are nonsense. Exploring Traveller’s vast “search space,” as mathematicians call it, require the ability to learn from experience, developing heuristics—rules of thumb—about which paths are most likely to yield reasonable solutions.\n\nIn 1981, Eurisko, a computer program that arguably displays the rudiments of such skills, easily won the Traveller tournament, becoming the top-ranked player in the United States and an honorary Admiral in the Traveller navy. Eurisko had designed its fleet according to principles it discovered itself—with some help from its inventor, Douglas B. Lenat, an assistant professor in Stanford University’s artificial-intelligence program.\n\n“I never did actually play Traveller by hand,” Lenat said, three years later. “I don’t think I even watched anybody play it. I simply talked to people about it and then had the program go off and design a fleet…When I went into the tournament that was the first time that I had ever played the game.”\n\nEurisko’s fleet was so obviously superior to those of its human opponents that most of them surrendered after the first few minutes of battle; one resigned without firing a shot.\n\nEurisko makes its discoveries by starting with a set of elementary concepts, given to it by a human programmer. Then, through a process not unlike genetic evolution, it modifies and combines them into more complex ideas. As structures develop, the most useful and interesting ones-judged according to standards encoded in the program-survive.\n\nAt the time of the Traveller tournament, Lenat had already used a forerunner of Eurisko to grow mathematical concepts, getting the program to rediscover arithmetic and some theorems in elementary number theory. Now the structures Lenat wanted to see evolve were Traveller fleets. He provided the program with descriptions of 146 Traveller concepts, some of them as basic as Acceleration, Agility, Weapon, Damage, and even Game Playing and Game. Others were more specific: Beam Laser, Meson Gun, Meson Screen, and Computer Radiation Damage.\n\nA Eurisko concept can be thought of as a box containing “slots” filled with information describing it. For example, the “Is A” slot in the box representing Energy Gun indicates that it is a Defensive Weapon Type and an Offensive Weapon Type—and a Physical Game Object, as well. These concepts are, in turn, described by other boxes. Another slot tells Eurisko that information on Energy Gun’s firing range will be found in a box called Energy Gun Attack Info.\n\nJohnson01.jpg\nDouglas B. Lenat\n\nWith a network of these boxes interlinked in its memory, Eurisko began designing ships and simulating battles. After each altercation, it analyzed the results, made adjustments to the fleets and tried the battle again. In the process, Eurisko tested Traveller concepts by natural selection. For example, after a number of battles, Eurisko discovered how easy it was to provide ships with enough armor to protect them against energy guns. Thus the value in the Worth slot of Energy Gun, which was originally set at 500, was eventually lowered to 100. Weapons that proved more valuable would increase in worth, toward a maximum value of 1000.\n\nGradually an ever-more-invincible Traveller fleet evolved.\n\n“At first,” Lenat later wrote, “mutations were random. Soon, patterns were perceived: more ships were better; more armor was better; smaller ships were better; etc. Gradually, as each fleet beat the previous one…its lessons were abstracted into new specific heuristics.”\n\nWhen Eurisko began its experiments, the My Creator slot in each of its concepts all contained the name Lenat. But, as Eurisko played, an increasing number of the slots were filled with the name of the heuristic that had been used to synthesize them.\n\nEurisko was creating concepts on its own. It was distilling thousands of experiences into the judgmental, almost intuitional, knowledge that constitutes expertise—rules that can’t always be proved logically, that can’t guarantee a correct answer, but that are reliable guides to the way the world works, a means of cutting through complexity and chaos.\n","domain":"self.MachineLearning","num_comments":16,"likes":null,"clicked":false,"thumbnail":"self","saved":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","ups":18,"approved_by":null,"score":9,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I found this article a few years ago when I was looking at heuristics.

If anything I have an embarrassment of riches and I am looking to prioritize.  The background is that I got accepted into a graduate certificate program in Data Mining that covers a lot of Machine Learning topics, and I am trying to make sure my math is up to speed.

Although I initially wanted to use dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA or LDA, it turned out that they offered little marginal benefit to warrant the added computational complexity. In the end, I decided to train independent supervised classifiers for the post's title text and its domain, and combined the two probability estimates for each subreddit to arrive at a holistic score for the post. I experimented with several types of classifier models (logistic regression, stochastic gradient descent, and naive bayes), and used the one-vs-all approach  to generalize the first two model types to handle more than two subreddits. Unfortunately, I did not have as much time as I hoped to explore the various avenues of this project (partially because I spent too long playing around with PCA and LDA, partially because I ended up spending more time than I wanted to on other classes), but I still feel I managed to get some decent results (which were comparable with the Prediction API results). \n\nYou can read my [project report](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/700763/229a_project.pdf) for more details about the exact implementation. Although it lacks any real figures because of the class-imposed 5 page limit, you can see some sample results in [this table](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/700763/table.pdf). You can also see the title text classifier features with the highest coefficients for each subreddit in [this table](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/700763/words.pdf), which can be thought of as the strongest indicators that a post should belong in that respective subreddit. Finally, you can see the code that I wrote for this project on [github](https://github.com/smoreinis/classificator), which also contains a data directory with a script to scrape new posts from Reddit (inspired by the same post from Nick Johnson) and some sample data for people to play around with.\n\nCode Miscellany: This code was written in python, and uses the numpy, scipy, simplejson, Stemmer, sklearn packages (and in fact was based on an sklearn tutorial on classifying newsgroup articles). The extract.py file handles the conversion of a JSON file full of posts into a feature dictionary, while models.py handles the actual supervised classification models provided by sklearn (as well as using CV grid search to find optimal parameters, and the CombinedClassifier which provides overall score posts). The gold.py file runs the whole thing - give it json files as arguments, and it should spit out the results for each type of sklearn classifier, which include a confusion matrix, overall F1-score, and a classification report like seen above. Finally, you can use the --topFeatures flag to print the highest coefficients (as seen above), but only if you are classifying on title text only (which is the way the code is set up now). To change it to classify posts based on title text and domain, change default value of combine to True on line 153 in models.py, comment out lines 173 an 178 in gold.py, and uncomment lines 174 and 177 (this is one of those things I'd have refactored to be prettier if I had the time, but hopefully it's not too confusing).\n\nI hope this can be of use to some of you - it seems there are several people trying to build recommendation systems for posts, so maybe this can provide at least a little insight into how much information can be gained from a post's title and domain.

Although all posts are currently uniformly weighted when training the supervised classifiers, changing this weighting (to either reflect the post&amp;#39;s number of upvotes, or some personalized ranking) could also yield some interesting results and potentially make the model&amp;#39;s results even better. Let me know if there are any questions!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","created":1324518984,"hidden":false,"over_18":false}
