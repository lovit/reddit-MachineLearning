I wanted to thank those who replied, and share the results of my coding. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The code is currently here: &lt;a href=\"http://github.com/bobschriver/GEN-OLM\"&gt;GEN-OLM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many people expressed concern about the fitness I would choose. I ended up looking for a few long-period cycles in the results, as well as large variation between values. I hoped this would create a more complicated and dynamic sound, which it mostly does.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m currently having an issue where some high fitness sentences generated from my program result in completely boring music, and haven&amp;#39;t quite figured out how to solve it, but it still produces other high fitness sentences which are interesting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few that I&amp;#39;ve picked out so far for being particularly interesting are these, which look much different than anything I&amp;#39;ve made by hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;( t * ( t ^ ( ( t &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 7 ) / 7 ) ) )\n( t * ( ( 5 - t ) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ( t ^ ( t - 9 ) ) ) )&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Feel free to play around with the program and modify as you please, and you can test the sentences it generates &lt;a href=\"http://wurstcaptures.untergrund.net/music/\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once again, thanks for all your advice and help, enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","created":1322599438,"hidden":false,"over_18":false}
