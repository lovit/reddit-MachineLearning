My dataset so far contains about 8 million samples of 1000 values (30GB), and all values have a mean of zero and standard deviation of one, and are highly correlated with at least a handful of other values.\n\n\nBefore I had read anything about imputation I assumed I could first build a covariance matrix estimate with my dataset (I'm OK with assuming the covariances are not changed by any missing data), and that after that I wouldn't need the data anymore, except for maybe a random sample of it that fits in memory to tune some hyper-parameters like the number of principal components to use in the case of PCA, or the noise and regularization for a marginalized denoising autoencoder.\n\n\nI also expected that the calculation of missing values was generally done using a closed form solution as a function of the known values and the weights of the linear reconstruction model, and possibly a regularization term as well.\n\n\nI was writing some code for handling the large amount of data to estimate the covariance matrix, and calculating a reconstruction matrix, but then I started reading to find the formula to do the imputation in closed form... but I couldn't find anything on that, just iterative methods.\n\n\nAm I missing something here? Is this a bad or impossible way to approach the problem?\n\n\nI would really like to know how to calculate the missing values from the known values and a weight matrix W   (W = P*P^T , where P is a matrix of the first few principal components).\n\nI think I would need to find the missing values of A that minimizes something like\n\n\n  (A * W - A)^2 +  lambda * Amissing ^2\n\n\nwhere lambda is the regularization term, A is a vector of input values, and Amissing are only the originally missing values.\n\n\nI suspect it's something like the differences between the reconstructed values and the input values, projected back to the missing values, a bit like back-propagation, and then multiplied by the inverse of some matrix. But I can't quite figure out the exact solution. \n\n\nIf anyone could help or suggest a better method, I would greatly appreciate it.\n\n\nThank you!\n\n\nedit:  \nI found this paper that seems related http://eigenvector.com/Docs/Wise_IFAC_91.pdf","media":null,"ups":7,"retrieved_on":1441238300,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/2cgrg0/closed_form_missing_value_imputation_question/"}

If you don't have access to Springer, NFQCA stands for Neurally Fitted Q-Learning with Continuous Actions, and it's an adaptation of the actor-critic architecture that uses a neural network for both the actor and critic (totaling two networks).  Some lecture slides that describe it are [here](http://www6.in.tum.de/pub/Main/TeachingWs2009MachineLearning/Slides_07.pdf).  Slide 11 gives an overview of the technique.  \n\n\n\n   In a nutshell, you have a feed-forward neural network (FFNN) that serves as the policy Pi(x), where x is a state vector.  The output of Pi(x) is *u*, an action.  Another FFNN serves as the critic, or Q function Q(x,u), and it produces a value *v*.  The output of Pi is part of the input of Q.  The state vector x is an input to both.  \n\n  From the paper, \n\n    In iteration step k of the NFQCA algorithm\n    we assume that the recent policy \u03c0_k represents the greedy evaluation of the Q-function:\n    \u03c0_k (x) \u2248 argmin_u (Q_k (x,u)). With this assumption we can formulate the Q-update without\n    a minimization step over all actions as Q-update(x, u) = c(x, u) + Q_k (x\u2032, \u03c0_k (x\u2032))\n\n\n...Where c(x, u) is a special cost function that smoothly approaches 0 from a constant *C* as the desired set-point (defined as some desired state) is reached, and x' is the action at time t+1.  The update for Q is regular backpropagation (the authors use RProp), but the update for Pi is a little different-- You simply carry the backpropagation from Q back through the linked input/output nodes, calculating a delta for Q's input layer as if it were hidden, and using this information to continue the backpropagation algorithm through Pi. \n\n\nThat seemed like a really neat trick, and I wanted to try it.  I have a simple cart-pole simulator set up and I'm using batch RMSProp (very similar to RProp) to update my Pi and Q networks.  Now that I have my learner all set up, I'm running into some trouble and I don't think it's a simple programming error.  First of all, doesn't the Q update rule look sort of odd for actor-critic?  Why are we summing costs instead of rewards?  In my algorithm, if learning start with the pole facing downward (furthest away from the reward state), then the cost for one action is 1/epoch_size (my value for *C*).  Q spits out some arbitrary, untrained value for the duration of the epoch, and the target values used to update the Q network all end up as more-or-less the same arbitrary value plus 1/epoch_size.  This results in the Pi network being encouraged to apply force in some direction, but iterating for another epoch never changes the situation-- as the cart slowly accelerates, the pole stays un-inverted and the Q/Pi networks get the same update over and over again, encouraging Pi to slowly apply more force in one direction or another.  The Q network's value estimations are pushed to 1.0 + (1/epoch_size), since each epoch encourages Q's output value to increase.  Something is wrong here.  There's no mechanism for exploration as with discrete-action Q-learning.  When (near) maximum cost for an entire epoch is reached, what about this algorithm is supposed to make behavior change?  Even resetting the simulation (but not the networks) on occasion and setting the pole to a random angle doesn't seem to change this.  Is something missing from this paper, or am I interpreting the update rule incorrectly?\n\n\n\n\n","retrieved_on":1441236886,"ups":4,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":0,"id":"2cjpra","archived":true,"name":"t3_2cjpra","gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author":"eubarch","from":null,"is_self":true,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/2cjpra/has_anyone_ever_implemented_nfqca_reinforcement/","secure_media":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","from_kind":null,"created":1407118335,"from_id":null,"stickied":false,"quarantine":false,"edited":false,"score":4}

Every paper would have its own section on the web, and people would be able to annotate words, sentences or images. There would be some review system for good notes, so the paper would not be bloated too much. Users would then be able to expand the annotations. The most favored, would appear first, as in stackexchange. It's common practice, that someone is asking for an explanation of some paper, so the information is scattered over the web. This way, the information would be all in one place. And users could ask questions simply inside the paper. \nSo my question is, how useful you think it would be?

{"media":null,"selftext":"Hi,\n\nI have data from two types (classes) of networks: net1, net2. Each network has 100 data instances. Each instance has twenty features and one output label.\n\nMy aims are two-fold: \n\n* build a classification model and \n* rank the features using fisher test and AUC\n\nThe labels for the data are floating numbers: 47.23, 67.5 etc. It can range from 0.0 to 100.0. If I use the labels as is, the prediction accuracy is, predictively, too low. I want to create bins to categorize these labels for a given range using k-means clustering algorithm. The number of labels hence will be the number of clusters I mention for the k-means algorithm. Once I build the model using k-fold cross validation, I will compare the performance by using two different kernels to start with: linear and RBF.\n\nI want to repeat the steps 1 and 2 for three cases: \n\n* data from only net1,\n* data from only net2 and \n* data from net1 and net2 (I will use +ve and -ve suffixes to separate the data from the two classes)\n\nand observe which features rank high. Feature ranking using Linear SVM [1] lists 4 methods for ranking that include fisher test and AUC.\n\nML isn't my area of expertise. Hence, I would like to hear from the reddit ML community if this is the correct approach. I would love to hear suggestions and comments.\n\n\nI started out with LibSVM but I didn't find it flexible to change the c and gamma parameters while using cross validation. I'm now using scikit-learn package in Python.\n\n\nThanks a lot!\n\n\n[1] Feature Ranking Using Linear SVM - http://core.kmi.open.ac.uk/download/pdf/16008.pdf#page=61","retrieved_on":1441224842,"ups":1,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/2d950g/categorizing_labels_using_kmeans_clustering_for_a/","link_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","title":"categorizing labels using k-means clustering for a SVM model","secure_media_embed":{},"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"MachineLearning","created_utc":"1407779512","author_flair_text":null,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","hide_score":false,"quarantine":false,"score":1,"edited":false,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/2d950g/categorizing_labels_using_kmeans_clustering_for_a/","secure_media":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","created":1407783112,"from_kind":null,"from_id":null,"stickied":false,"author":"bkamapantula","from":null,"is_self":true,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":0,"archived":true,"id":"2d950g","link_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t3_2d950g","gilded":0}

Right now I get how they work, and how some other methods work such as SVM, logistic regression,... However I feel that even though I KNOW how they work, I do not yet fully UNDERSTAND.\n\nI know the difference between supervised/unsupervised learning, I have participated in some kaggle challenges, succesfully using sklearn and other libraries to train and finetune commonly used models.\n\nWhat I do need: beginner-intermediate mathemathical books/resources on machine learning/neural networks\n\nWhat I don't need: practical books that teach about using a ML library like sklearn, torch, ...\n\nIn other words, I am currently viewing machine learning very much from the programming/practical side of the spectrum, but I would like to get more into the theoretical/mathemathical side.\n\nIf the uses programming exercises or the likes, that's not a problem, as long as the main focus is on the theory/mathemathics and the reasons for the theory/math.\n\nI hope that's clear enough and that you guys can help, thanks!","permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/2djem5/theoretical_resourcesbooks/","link_flair_text":null}

The idea is to have a large \"brain sandbox\", some space where vast quantities of reinforcement learning algorithms exist. One can then search through this algorithm-space with something like a genetic algorithm.\n\nERL tries to remain as unrestrictive on the possible learning algorithms that can present themselves as possible, while remaining computationally feasible. In order to speed things up, it runs on the GPU using OpenCL.\n\nERL consists of a field of nodes (not called neurons since they can function entirely differently from the neurons we know), each with connections to several of its neighbors. Each node has a dynamical system, encoded into genes using a compositional pattern producing network, that governs the node's output(s) (there can be several outputs per node). Each connection also has a dynamical system, which governs its output(s). On top of the connections, nodes can also spread a \"gas\" (or several gases) to other nodes as an alternative form of node communication.\n\nThe dynamical systems (compositional pattern producing networks) are run through an OpenCL kernel language rule compiler for maximum performance and readability.\n\nInputs are clusters of nodes which receive additional external inputs that go through an encoder dynamical system. Similarly, outputs are clusters whose outputs are averaged and passed through a decoder.\n\nFurthermore, the field is divided into regions using yet another compositional pattern producing network. This gives each node a \"type ID\" that allows it to function in unique ways.\n\nTogether, these components form a generic node-network that can learn many different kinds of learning rules, but with the restriction that these learning rules must be mostly local (they use information available at the connection/node level).\n\nIn order to evolve a general reinforcement learning agent (that's the goal of this project, although theoretically it can do all types of learning), each genotype is evaluated on a set of experiments. These experiments have their resulting fitness values scaled and summed before being passed to the evolutionary algorithm.\n\nOver time (several generations), I have noticed a steady increase in fitness on the experiments. So the concept is at least not entirely without merit.\n\nIt is quite processing intensive, so far I haven't really trained it past around 60 generations. But with longer training times, and improvements to the genotype representation and evolutionary algorithm, performance of the genes should improve drastically (I hope).\n\nWith this I attempted to do something entirely novel. It is quite possible that someone has thought of this concept before, but I haven't found any evidence of an implementation so far.\n\nThis software is free and open source. Zlib license.\nIt is still early, but it functions. Here it is on GitHub: [https://github.com/222464/ERL](https://github.com/222464/ERL)\n\nThe README's description of the project is somewhat outdated (I wrote it before actually coding anything, that's why it is in future tense), but I will update it soon with a more detailed explanation of what is going on.\n\nNow, I would love to hear criticisms or ideas for improvement. Or maybe some computing time. Or maybe even a code contribution! ;)\n\nHere is a video of ERL doing pole balancing. The video happened after 16 generations (I got too impatient to evolve it for longer :P). This is about 45 minutes of evolution time if I had to guess. The stuff on the right side shows the first output of each node in the field.\n\nSEIZURE WARNING! The neural field tends to flicker...\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwhtyG1PPag&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwhtyG1PPag&amp;feature=youtu.be)\n\nTL;DR: Evolving learning algorithms from scratch.","media":null}

Each node and edge has several features (the tree specific ones like depth, and parent, but also some other data- categorical or numerical features which are discovered once that node is explored). I need to write an algorithm for exploring this tree, with the aim of finding the goal node in as few steps as possible.\n\nAt each step, the algorithm has 2 decisions to make:\n\n* 1) Which already-explored node should we start from?\n\n* 2) Which edge from that node should be explored next (some edge properties such as type are known before exploring down it).\n\nThat edge &amp; the node at the end are then explored, and the algorithm loops.\n\nSome of the properties on the nodes&amp;edges are related to finding the goal node. Examples of valid rules might be: \n\n* When feature A == 100, then the goal node is a child of that node. In that case, it makes sense to focus exploration on children of that node. \n\n* When B == 'category1' then exploring down the edge of type X is frequently where the goal is.\n\n* If you came down an edge of type X to get to this node, and this node has B &gt; 50, then explore from here down an edge of type Y.\n\nI'm looking for a way to discover these rules, and so build an algorithm that can explore to find the goal quickly by looking at the signs (features on nodes) along the way.\n\nI have a bunch of trees for which I have found the goal by brute-force exploration, and am hoping to use them as training data to determine what features might be important and learn rules this exploration algorithm should follow.\n\n\n**Possible approaches**\n\nI have done some machine learning and participated in Kaggle competitions before, but always where the training data was clear, independent rows of data with a clearly defined label and error metric. I really don't know the best approach to take to get my tree into that form, or even if that's what I should be doing? A* / Djikstra seem like they might have a use here, but they all require a single \"distance\" measure, which I don't have. Perhaps I should attempt to learn a regressor which maps from the features on a node to some kind of distance metric? Or just train a model to produce a binary \"should explore\" prediction (using what features)?\n\nHas anyone tackled anything like this before? Any suggestions on what to try? Good resources for machine learning rules &amp; exploration paths? Ways of converting trees to rows which I can learn from?

I never get tired of it for some reason. As such, I've collected quite a few LA texts, and I now have a new favorite! Here are some of the reasons I really enjoy this text:\n\n*Coding the Matrix* is a computational approach to LA and starts with the assumption of a finite domain, thus, it is able to focus on a lot of practical computational examples, and skip the complications of infinite domains.\n\nAdding to the above notion, the book focuses on portraying vectors as functions on finite domains which is a wonderful way to present them as it makes connecting them to practical applications very direct. \n\nEverything is in Python. I don't make this claim because I'm a Python fan (I am, but not a daily user or fanboy). I point this out because Python is used in ML and compsci, and therefore will be at least familiar to many readers. In addition, even those who love other languages would agree that Python has great mathematical tools, a large community, is free, is great for 'sketching' things quickly with tools like IPython notebooks. In addition, and this isn't Python-specific, the author has us think of vectors as functions on finite domains, and as such, there is heavy use of representing vectors as sparse dictionaries, which languages like Python do quite well.\n\nThe text spends a lot of time on signals, sparsity, compression, and other popular compsci topics. [edit for this subreddit: there are a ton of examples which ML enthusiasts will recognize throughout the book.] The author seems to have an endless supply of simple, practical examples which are sometimes just sprinkled in the main text, or presented as labs or asides.\n\nThere are a lot of great popular culture references to *The Matrix*, other Movies, and tons of xkcd comics which are always very related to the topic in the text, but keep the volume from being oppressive.\n\nAnyway, if you like linear algebra topics, and lots of great compsci applications thereof, I highly recommend this book.

Each class is represented by 2K samples in the dataset.\n\nA Neural network trains to converge those 2K values per-class to 500 values in its final layer per class (leaving you with 2500 samples instead of 10 000), which are representative of all the training data. You would then store these final layers in sort of a lookup table.\n\nYour test data will go through the same neural network, and you will then take the k-NN of the final layer, compared to the values you previously stored in the lookup table.\n\nAlternatively I could pre-process the data and take the mean of each of 4 values which are closest to each other which would also reduce the data to 500 samples per class, but I feel this would probably be very destructive towards the data, and so perhaps a neural network could learn better intermediate representations.\n\nHas there been any research on anything like this?
