In a world where employers only seem to look at credentials, I'm unsure what they are looking *for* exactly. I programmed in VB6 for about 15 years (since I was 12), and did some C# and other languages and even assembly, but what I really need is a training experience. I have an MBA instead of a CS degree but I don't have time right now to go re-do my degree (don't feel it's particularly useful at this point compared to real life experiences); I'd rather take a few pertinent training classes or work an internship because that's practical and efficient. I can't seem to find any community here in Reno NV for AI (maybe I need to look nationally and coordinate online, but where/how? I'm not that good at finding it apparently); I have guessed that socialization is the key to finding some opportunity. Right now I just design A-Life simulations at home, but I would like to learn more working on a real AI project. I have a specific interest in intelligent agents / digital organisms and general AI development, but I see most of the work is on narrow AI for vision and other specific problem domains.\n\nI am completely lost at how to find a mentor for this. I originally learned to program because I wanted to make games, so my approach is half art and half science (and I think some creativity and philosophy is necessary in these fields - to think out of the box and design new patterns). Outside a university, I haven't seen where I can get into this. I don't think it's an intractable problem; after all, I can read and learn what I don't know. It's just unlocking an opportunity to learn that is challenging. Does anyone have ideas on where I can go, who I can talk to? What communities have projects I can learn from/participate in? There must be some action I can take to advance, to get help with it (even if just theory discussions)?\n\nI believe AI is what will fundamentally change mankind, and thus is among the most important focus points along with supporting technologies like quantum computers. I am also interested in computer ethics, a very small but important field. I believe I will have ideas to contribute when I encounter new information; I just want the chance to do so.\n\nThank you for any input regarding this. I feel very lost right now when people keep telling me what I can't do based only on credentials when I know that I can do it with a passion; I can learn, after all ...","retrieved_on":1440699009,"ups":0}

The pace of progress and the applicability to my line of work is so high that I have to keep up with papers that are only months or even weeks old. It's a great feeling to be on the cutting edge in industry. I can't think of any other research field that creates tangible results as fast as this one.\n\n...but please cut the [marginally state-of-the-art](http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/2wk8yi/discuss_the_elephant_in_the_room_of_machine/) crap. You may think that this recent [Baidu ImageNet retraction](http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/announcement-June-2-2015) is just a lapse in moral judgement, but it's part of a bigger issue in the community. \n\n-Those who participate in writing state-of-the-art in their papers without any statistic showing how significant that number are just as guilty. You're hiding the reproducibility of your research. If it takes too long to run more than one sample, note that in your results.\n\n-Those that consider state-of-the-art as a bar that should be met for publication (especially reviewers) are just as guilty. You're creating an environment that supports this state-of-the-art endemic. Having collarborated with those in research, it clearly pressures researchers in a highly competitive field to run and re-run their analyses with tiny tweaks till they get the result they want.\n\nSo those of you that are writing the phrase state-of-the-art in your next papers, think about what it means before writing it. It may seem like a golden ticket to getting your paper published, but stop for a moment and think about how you came to your result. How much effort did you spend on the actual idea and how much did you spend on trying to get it to converge to the number you wanted?\n\nHal Daume III wrote a [great piece about this issue](http://nlpers.blogspot.com/2014/11/the-myth-of-strong-baseline.html). Here's an excerpt:\n\n&gt;[...] There are lots of ways to be better than such a baseline, and so \"beating\" it does not teach me anything. I always tell students not to get too pleased when they get state of the art performance on some standard task: someone else will beat them next year. If the only thing that I learn from their papers is that they win on task X, then next year there's nothing to learn from that paper. The paper has to teach me something else to have any sort of lasting effect: what is the generalizable knowledge.\n\n&gt; The point is that an evaluation is not an end in itself. An evaluation is there to teach you something, or to substantiate something that I want to teach you. If I want to show you that X is important, then I should show you an experiment that isolates X to the best of my ability and demonstrates an improvement, preferably also with an error analysis that shows that what I claim my widget is doing is actually what it's doing.\n\nTo deep learning researchers: Stop throwing all the tricks in the book to push your numbers up (ie dropout, sophisticated optimizers, fancy parameter initialization, dataset augmentation). If you need these tricks to prove your point, then I'm sorry to say you don't have one. Your results are meaningless since you've confounded it with so many other things. **Instead of spending so much effort pushing your method to state-of-the-art performance, how about spending some time simplifying it.** Show that the intuitions you had for your idea is in fact what's happening. Coming from someone on the application side, **if your idea isn't simple to implement or intuitive, no one will use it.** \n\nOccam's razor has so much truth in this field.

Let us say the environmental challenge is to find and consume substance A (\"food\") faster than it is consumed internally. When the Agents meet a criteria (say, a high enough average lifespan indicating a high degree of success feeding themselves), the environment adds a new complexity, substance B. The input nodes are created to detect B similar to A, and maybe output nodes to consume it (if consumption of B is mutually exclusive with the action to consume A). Now, new connections and nodes need to be formed to connect the new inputs and outputs. This may continue until the number of substances to be consumed is too high for the number of actions available per unit of time and consumption rate; realistically the success threshold will just not be met beyond a certain point if it is a fixed value (but the Agents will optimize to the degree they can).\n\nThere are 2 sets of questions (mainly design philosophy) regarding the Agents adapting to new I/O in the environment, and the environment creating new I/O complexity for the Agents:\n\n1) When a new I/O set is formed, should the network generate some structures (like a cluster with random connections to existing clusters) automatically, or create them slowly over time as it normally does? The question regards mapping new I/O, in much the same way that a person can learn to use a cybernetic limb (new limb). We normally think in terms of the internal nodes shifting and changing, but it's possible to gain new percepts and new actions in a simulation here and I haven't seen that discussed before and am not sure how to approach it.\n\n2) While this demonstrates the environment training the Agents incrementally over time, it is simplistic and only adds challenges in one manner (of one sort); how can an environment \"learn\" how to train Agents? Should its utility be based on \"killing them faster\" in a competitive manner such that the environment and Agents are directly at odds (Agents already compete with each other in the environment)? Can the environmental model actually be run by a neural network itself? I am asking this because I am limited in how I can think up a simulation challenge and I wonder if the environment can go further by creating its own kind of Agents with different constraints and actions than the ones being tested, and adjusting parameters - this would require a very open-ended simulation, more like a sandbox; also, the difference between the environment rating itself based on \"beating\" the tested Agents as opposed to rating itself based on their success (harmful/challenging vs. helpful/assist) - perhaps if it changes between these roles, making the simulation harder until they begin to fail, then making it easier until they begin to succeed, as long as over time the \"difficulty\" keeps increasing (but how to measure \"difficulty\"?)\n\nI feel that understanding the theory of how the simulation/environment can \"teach\" may be just as important as how Agents \"learn\". It can have access to parameters that tell it how the Agents are doing, or it may evaluate that on its own scale somehow.

For NN I have always encoded the input either as a continuum (-1 to 1, or 0 to 1 for parameters that fall within a min/max range) or as a categorical boolean (1 if matching/applicable, 0 if not applicable) which can encode 1 bit of information. This often requires many units for a \"simple simulation input\" like a map tile.\n\nI considered using an FSM network instead with symbol encoding (just integers really). It seems easier to map simulation parameters directly to these inputs. For example, an input which senses the type of map tile to the left of the agent may have values A-Z or 0-9 (it can be any integers but this selection helps readability), and the subtype perhaps the same range of values; so the information is encoded in 1-2 processing units instead of N, where N is the number of types. With the NN mapping it can be 1 node per possibility (the input node has direct meaning) or it could be log2 N where the NN has to learn what the combination of active nodes means but each bit alone has no distinct meaning, but there are less units to process.\n\nIn the FSM network I imagined, inputs are concatenated to an input string then run through a rules engine/mapping table (the rules evolve over time). So if for example the tiles in all 4 cardinal directions were connected to a processing unit from the inputs, you might have AB + CD + EF + GH (assuming 2 units per tile), and Z the current internal state, and thus the string \"ZABCDEFGH\" would be run through the rules list until a match is found; perhaps the new state next tick would be \"J\". I also learned that an FSM that saves previous states or has a state change delay may act similarly to an RNN, for example if the next 5-10 states were buffered. It is of course possible to have a loop like states A-&gt;B-&gt;C-&gt;A or A-&gt;A (no change without specific inputs) and so \"memory\" of states can be preserved over arbitrary length time in a similar manner to the LSTM NN units.\n\nThe advantage of such a design may be that it is discrete: if my output unit A-E corresponds to the numbers 1-5, and the selected number is (1) the temporal index of a memory block to recall, N steps ago, or (2) the index of an input to send a signal to and/or the value to send, then I can do some things that I think would be more difficult for an NN to learn/encode (and if it did, it would be difficult for me to figure out how it did it - here it is more transparent by halting the simulation and reviewing the values at time T). So, the units can perform discrete indexing \"decisions\" and the category boundaries are not ambiguous. NN can technically also do this using a step function, but there is no continuous value relationship here with the categories that really makes sense (0.1 going to 0.2 and bumping the step function from B to C). Instead of add/multiply/activation function, the FSM performs an arbitrary mapping of input + current state to output state (which could also be an output string to each receiving unit depending on complexity).\n\nThe disadvantage is that the FSM is brittle: if the string order changes (links are added/removed) then it may fail, unless the rules are mapped via values and the specific unit index from which the input is coming (so that the order of characters in the string doesn't matter, only their sources). It needs to be malleable like an NN to network structural changes.\n\nThe reason I am thinking about it is temporal memory encoding of \"engrams\". I have thus far not been able to have an NN perform this operation: \"recall my inputs (or specific unit values in X cluster) from T time units in the past\". An LSTM cell will hold a value for an indefinite period of time potentially, but not necessarily from a specific time. The FSM structure above can both address the memory cluster index and the temporal index for the purpose of recall. It's possible that spiking NN can also do memory association and recall but I haven't explored that yet.\n\nThe purpose of that is so that the agent can make some kind of association: 30 time steps ago, it ate a red plant (some specific object type like \"QV\"). Now it is poisoned or otherwise damaged. The look-back mechanism requires some memory to correlate action:consequence, but they are not always immediately associated in time. How exactly a network can learn that input \"QV\" is an object to be avoided when the consequence is not directly attributable to it (it's possibly NOT the cause of the consequence) is currently beyond my understanding. Human beings associate things incorrectly all the time (attributing causes for things that are incorrect based on correlations, or not connecting cause and effect over long periods of time). An LSTM cell can retain a value... but how can we \"remember\" input sets, output sets, and possibly the internal state in the future when we are looking for causes across time? Further, how can we use that information for any kind of \"learning\"? Except... since it is a simulation we can reverse time and take a different branch (action) and then compare the new future where we are not poisoned and say \"aha!\" that's where it happened. In humans, memory allows us to simulate going back in time (to a degree) to try to find that decision node, and maybe dreams are the alternate simulation. In a computer however we can store and go back precisely if we wanted to, and perhaps the agent can find their own mistake - they are not \"temporally bound\" like we are. They can evolve until they correct the decision maybe? OK that is interesting... I haven't seen any reading on that before.\n\nAnyone care to expand on the idea?","permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/38ahxl/input_encoding_for_nn_vs_fsm_some_ideas/","link_flair_text":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"Input Encoding for NN vs. FSM, some ideas","distinguished":null,"thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"hide_score":false,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","subreddit":"MachineLearning","media_embed":{},"author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1433286777"}

Now while describing the experiences people often compare a similar dish to the one they had in the restaurant for which they describe their experience. Now, the problem that I am trying to solve is, I want to map the specific dishes to the restaurants in which they are served or are available and that I want to do solely from the raw text that is available to me, using some kind of contextual text analysis, that is I want to programmatically determine if the dish is also served in some other restaurant or not from the text itself.

The results could often be surprisingly complex, but it would require hundreds of generations before even the simplest behaviors manifested themselves. I'm hoping this time to implement an AI that could learn in a more continuous manner from past experiences, instead of through random mutation. That is to say, navigate the solution space in a directed manner (backpropagation) and have the ability to learn features in sequential real-time data (maybe using RNNs?). \n\nWhat interests me with this game is both its simplicity and the fact that it is played by a number of human players, allowing the AIs to be pitted directly against smart contestants in online games and thus eliminating a number of low-complexity traps that can arise from competitive co-evolution.\n\nSo, if anyone has any ideas, research papers to read or techniques that might be fun to implement, please let me know! Moreover, if current tools or packages can be used to optimize the rate of improvement and make use of GPUs (instead of having to code everything from scratch, which can of course be in itself an interesting project), I would be interested in hearing advice from people with experience using such tools.","retrieved_on":1440688798,"ups":24,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"MachineLearning","created_utc":"1433557279","author_flair_text":null,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","hide_score":false,"distinguished":null,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","title":"A bot for Agar.io","secure_media_embed":{}}

In my case, I'll be using Matlab and Murphy's Bayes Net Toolbox (freely available here: [source](https://github.com/bayesnet/bnt) ).\n\nAll the machine learning books I've checked out so far go into great depth about machine learning (i.e. Murphy's \"Machine Learning: A probabilistic perspective\" or Koller/Friedman \"Probabilistic graphical models: principles and techniques\"), but I've not seen a more superficial publication which talks about how some often occuring types of problems should be modeled.\n\nFor example, a simple classification task: there are a number of observable, continuous features (random variables) which should be used to predict human behavior.\nWhat's a good starting point for a model?\n\nFor example, DeVaul uses this to classify one of two classes ([source: about in the middle of this file](https://www.media.mit.edu/wearables/mithril/BNT/mixtureBNT.txt)):\n\n             +-------+\n    Node 1   | Class |\n             |  A/B  |\n             +-------+\n                | \\\n                |  \\\n                |   \\\n                |    V\n                |  +-----------+\n                |  | component |  Node 2\n                |  |    1/2    |\n                |  +-----------+\n                |       /\n                |      /\n                V     V\n               .--------.\n     Node 3   /          \\\n             /  Gaussian  \\\n             \\  mu, sigma /\n              \\          / \n               \\________/ \n\nI've not seen this one anywhere else. Is this a good starting point?\n\nAnother one I've seen is the model in figure 1 on page 2 of [this paper](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.00060.pdf). It's a temporal model, but just use the left column of it and that's basically a 'normal' static bayesian network. I would love to understand the reasoning how someone comes up with a model like this.\n\nTL;DR version: are there any good practices out there for representing standard problems as graphical models?

{"media":null,"selftext":"Hey,\n\nI have this setting where I try to determine which of a set of documents is closest to a specific set of documents. While thinking about this problem I thought this should be possible by modeling topics inferred by these sets of documents. Unfortunately I have no experience with topic modeling yet, so I was wondering if you could point me to resources that deal with this problem. My ideas so far where to infer an arbitrary number of topics of the \"target\" set of documents, and then to look at each document in each of my other document sets in order to see how much they are similar to these topics. The other idea was to model topics for each document set and try to compare each sets' distribution over topics. However I don't know how to do this when using arbitrary topics. The third idea was to use some kind of clustering approach for all documents and try to see which clusters are closest. Maybe you could comment on these ideas?

The purpose of this post is to collect guidelines, tips, experiences and references to literature (or any other form of information) as input for my graduation project.\n\n \n\n**About me**\n\nI'm a 21 years old dutch student, doing a study to become a software engineer (I'm not sure about the name in english). Currently I'm busy with my graduation project, for which I'll need to choose and test several Machine Learning algorithms for a case given to me within the company. I have no prior experience to Machine Learning, so it's a bit of a struggle (but I chose for it myself since I find the subject very intriguing).\n\n**The Question in general**\n\nGiven a product, which market characteristics are a best match?\n\nSo basically the input will be product, and characters output.\nProduct =&gt; {C1, C2, Cn... }\n\nSo for example, a marketer wants to advertise for a specific product, product A. He'll give this product as input. Based on this, the system should respond with the target market he should make advertisements for. An example would be: Female, 20-30 years, has a car\n\n**The problem**\n\nFor my assignment, I'll have to choose a Machine learning algorithm, that will be able to select the most succesful market segment characteristics for that product. Based on transactional data, which could look something like this:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/t8ttVZL.png\n\nSo a product can occur multiple times, like here (with other characteristics):\n\nhttp://imgur.com/IqD1iyC\n\n\n(I don't have any real data, but I've been told it's safe to assume merged together it'll look like this when dummyfied).\n\n\nGiven this, the product (products will be clustered in relevant before this step, but my assignment is about this step) should predict what categories are relevant for the marketers.\n\nI've done quite a bit of literature research, and tried to find how other people solved similar problems. After a lot  of searching, I've made the following list:\n\n* Naive bayes\n* Neural Network\n* Random forest\n* Decision Tree\n*Support Vector Machine (of Support Vector Network)\n*Logistic Regression\n* Apriori (ass. rules)\n* Eclat (ass. rules)\n* FP-growth (ass. rules)\n* k-means\n* Collaborative filtering\n* Principal Component Analysis(PCA)\n\nNow I'm pretty sure that PCA isn't the solution. It might be useful to shorten the amount of features, but it won't solve my main problem.\n\nSo far, by prototyping a bit, I found that Collaborative filtering and Ass. rules solutions seem to give a reasonable solution, but that's purely from an informal, exploratory view.\n\nHowever, that's as far as I've come.\n\n**The Questions**\n\nI'm trying to shorten the list to candidates to test for the given project. I assume it's a supervised problem (characteristics are the labels). But I can't seem to wrap my head on how this should be implemented. Most examples I find have multiple predictors and a single response variable, while I'm trying to predict multiple responses, based on a single predictor.\n\n1. Am I on the right track? I've really been doubting myself a lot regarding the choices. These options seem to be used for marketing/market segmentation, or how you'll call it, but I don't see them solving my problem.\n2. If I am, how can I shorten the current list so I have enough time to test the remaining algorithms?

I *have* counter-examples after all, and even if they don't fully represent the space of all counter-examples, including them in training will still be helpful.\n\nAre there any implementations of SVDD out there that allow for this?

I have been through Theano's first tutorials, and feel that I am starting to get a hang of things, though on a Macbook Air, it feels like experimenting will be painful.\n\nI feel I have reached a point where I should start experimenting more and apply some of the techniques covered in Geoffrey Hinton's class. I have selected a simple problem, that of skewed numbers for OCR purposes. Essentially, I would like to OCR text that may have been warped (as in perspective projection) and rotated.\n\nIn order to keep the problem simple, I have decided to use a monospace font, with black printed on white. So we are looking at digits ranging from 0-9, with rotation angles ranging from -15 degrees to +15 degrees, and non-uniform scaling ranging from -20% to +20% on the left side and -20% to +20% on the right side of the letters (this whole approach is subject to debate, but I have found this to be most practical to generate test cases and size the search space).\n\nSo, if we break this down by single degrees and single %, the search space yields 30 * 40 * 40 for each digit, so a total of 480000 combinations, spread over a grid of w x p (= n) pixels.\n\nDoes this mean I need a minimum 480000 x n  inputs?\nIf I want to use convolutional NN, does this means I need to use this say x 4 or x 16?\n\nWhat about the hidden layers?\n\nLast bit, regarding outputs: would it be possible to have 10 outputs (for each digits) + 3 (rotation + scale1 + scale2)?\n\nThanks for any pointers, considerations or other approaches.\n\nPS: Any good books or references on the design of NN (choice of parameters etc..)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/397dma/hands_on_with_a_simple_problem_rotated_ocr_text/","title":"Hands on with a simple problem (Rotated OCR Text), advices??","secure_media_embed":{},"downs":0,"thumbnail":"default","distinguished":null,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","hide_score":false,"created_utc":"1433880177","author_flair_text":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"MachineLearning"}

The current output of the GA is an interval level vector of scores that rank orders very well and has a nice normal-ish distribution, but the scale is arbitrary and meaningless.  Transforming that to P(event) scale is needed in order to use the score in downstream BI and decision sciences.\n\nCurrently we calibrate using SAS PROC LOGISTIC and the usual transformation of the resulting log odds to p_event, but I want to eliminate the I/O step that involves scoring the raw data file, running PROC LOGISTIC, saving the output of that regression, and then writing the equation to get the log odds, and then transforming log odds to probability of event, and then finally saving the data set at the end of that last data step. \n\nThe issue we are running into is that we have implemented Mahout's SGD classifier, which yields final scaling that ranges from 0 to 1, but the calibration is off.  Sometimes it is off by just a little, sometimes it is very far off.  Here's an example of where it is far off:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/eYBF3eK.jpg\n\nDEPVAR_ARTHRITIS is the dependent variable, predicted probability is what we get when we take the score generated by the GA and run it through logistic regression, derive the log odds, and transform to p_arthritis, and MLRP is what we get from implementing Mahout's SGD logistic regression as described on this web page:\n\nhttp://blog.trifork.com/2014/02/04/an-introduction-to-mahouts-logistic-regression-sgd-classifier/\n\nAs you can see the Mahout's value is scaled correctly between 0 and 1 across the entire range of observed scores, but it is not calibrated as well as what we get when we use simple logistic regression in SAS or SPSS.  In fact, the calibration sucks.  The rate of arthritis diagnosis is .62, but the average p_arthritis score coming out of the system is .66.  Ugh.\n\nHowever, the results vary from case to case.  In this second example, the average value of the output of Mahout's procedure is equal to the actual event rate to the 3rd decimal place, but the calibration is off at both tails of the distribution, relative to the calibration achieved by running the score the GA creates through PROC LOGISTIC and then scaling the log odds to P_OUTCOME.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/SGo9vnC.jpg\n\nWe are not beholden to Mahout's SGD method of logistic regression, we just need something that works in Java, that can take the output of what the GA has created that is on an arbitrary numeric scale, and translate that to p_event in a manner that is well calibrated and meaningful / easy to interpret / works every time.  The faster it operates the better.\n\nAny assistance / guidance would be appreciated, am posting here first to give redditors first dibs on a solution but also will follow up with Mahout experts at the various websites if we come up dry here.","media":null,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","hide_score":false,"created_utc":"1433959703","author_flair_text":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"MachineLearning","title":"Mahout's SGD Logistic Regression -- can we get the output of scoring to calibrate to probability(event = 1) ???","preview":{"images":[{"id":"CTbEQwUOdvNuuylVzXC0LQcY3sO8WWnFCfQPvyJxQhQ","variants":{},"source":{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/_AGdtisca1vOKvai8jneN-bEKd2jtFQSLM055puRLeU.jpg?s=3ac2b3bac85d36df2fad947c27a14c6f","width":1152,"height":648},"resolutions":[{"height":60,"width":108,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/_AGdtisca1vOKvai8jneN-bEKd2jtFQSLM055puRLeU.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=d0e465df1616da83bc5d13e887a58892"},{"width":216,"height":121,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/_AGdtisca1vOKvai8jneN-bEKd2jtFQSLM055puRLeU.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=6ce8996eaa5cb00e68d84409495652d6"},{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/_AGdtisca1vOKvai8jneN-bEKd2jtFQSLM055puRLeU.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=e8ff751e29ddd7005edfe43398c688eb","height":180,"width":320},{"width":640,"height":360,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/_AGdtisca1vOKvai8jneN-bEKd2jtFQSLM055puRLeU.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;s=9edbc703fbb06ae5ce978108c18f7949"},{"width":960,"height":540,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/_AGdtisca1vOKvai8jneN-bEKd2jtFQSLM055puRLeU.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=960&amp;s=a0915983626604102d8ef67506fc9090"},{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/_AGdtisca1vOKvai8jneN-bEKd2jtFQSLM055puRLeU.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=1080&amp;s=30af45c83d43d6f11e907a2c2aac7d4a","width":1080,"height":607}]}]},"secure_media_embed":{},"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","distinguished":null}

The most common object is faces, and there are off the shelf classifiers (such as a haar cascade) for opencv.\n\nThe procedure for training a [haar cascade using open cv](http://note.sonots.com/SciSoftware/haartraining.html) is well defined, but labor intensive.  It involves:\n\n* Collecting images that contain the object\n* Annotating the images to draw boxes around the parts of the image that contain the object of interest.\n* Annotating the images to draw boxes around the parts of the image that DO NOT contain the object of interest.\n* Training the software (which can take days or weeks of computation time)\n* Validating the model with test data that was not in the training set.\n\nThe image collection could be provided by the user/client.  Then this batch of images could be farmed out to, say, Mechanical Turks or volunteers for annotation.  \n\nThe annotators would receive a link that contains the picture and a simple browser based paint interface.  The annotator would then paint the regions that had the object, say with a solid red color.  This would be something like the [Peekaboom platform](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~biglou/Peekaboom.pdf) but updated (peekaboom was written in 2006)\n\nThe annotation would then be sent back to the server to define regions where the image was present and not.  These image segments could then be put into the Haar cascade learning pipeline.\n\nThis would make a nice digital business actually.  The client would be responsible for providing the image set, some description of the object, and some positive controls (to train and validate the human annotators).  The company would then farm out the annotation, farm out the haar cascade learning, and then provide the resulting haar cascade as a product. \n\nThe company could go one step further and offer to retain the haar cascade and apply it to batches of new images from the client.  This way the client never needs to use/implement any image recognition software, they just get what they want of object identification.\n\nNone of these steps is particularly hard, it is just a matter of organizing them into a pipeline and marketing the product.\n\nExamples of things that people have wanted to identify include:\n\n* defective parts in a manufacturing process\n* misapplied labels\n* spoiled pieces of fruit\n* certain types of vehicles \n* certain types of cells under a microscope\n\nIf this pipeline were inexpensive enough it could be used ubiquitously for mundane tasks such as:\n \n* creating an approximate inventory of my refrigerator or pantry from a digital image (i.e. identify milk, yogurt, apples, celery etc).\n* Annotating people's pictures of their food (i.e. mashed potatoes, peas, carrots..)\n* Helping me search my photos for my dog, cat, or pet iguana.\n* Diagnosing an iron deficiency in my spider plant\n\nMaybe this already exists, and if so let me know!

He doesn't go into much detail but he mentions that they are experimenting with Hierarchical LSTMs, and they are using them in \"dialogue agents\".

{"selftext":"I'm wondering if anyone has any literature or experience in using encoder-decoder RNNs or LSTMs to generate sentence/phrase vectors to use for e.g. clustering or search.  The idea would be have an RNN auto-encode a phrase by requiring it to encode then decode the same phrase and to use the resulting encoding vector (i.e. the final hidden state of the encoder) as a \"phrase vector\".  I've tried doing this on a smallish corpus but the resulting vectors don't seem to cluster particularly well.  Ideally one would want the encoding to live in some semantic space so that nearby vectors correspond to phrases with similar meanings, not just words.  It might well be that the task of simply encoding then decoding a phrase does not really require the network to learn any meaning so the resulting vectors might just be some compressed bag of words.

{"selftext":"I am having trouble understanding exactly how the RNN Encoder-Decoder used in [1,2] is trained. The authors give qualitative descriptions of the model but don't explicitly give the error function. [1] states that the model is trained to maximize the log probability of the correct output sequence, that is the sum of the logs of the probabilities. But how is the probability of an output sequence given by the model? Does the whole softmax (probability over vocabulary) outputted at each timestep become input to the next timestep? It seems like that must be the case, because in training mode, it doesn't seem like we can sample from the softmax- that would not be differentiable. \n\n[1] - [Sutskever et al.](http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215)\n[2] - [Cho et al.](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.1078v3.pdf).\n","media":null,"ups":1,"retrieved_on":1440668117,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/39yvqy/understanding_maximum_likelihood_error_function/","thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"distinguished":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"Understanding Maximum Likelihood Error Function for RNN Encoder-Decoder","author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1434407018","subreddit":"MachineLearning","media_embed":{},"hide_score":false,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","score":1,"edited":false,"quarantine":false,"from_id":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","from_kind":null,"created":1434410618,"secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/39yvqy/understanding_maximum_likelihood_error_function/","stickied":false,"from":null,"author":"[deleted]","is_self":true,"num_comments":3,"author_flair_css_class":null,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t3_39yvqy","archived":false,"id":"39yvqy"}

Unfortunately, I've run into some problems (largely due to my lack of calculus knowledge).\n\n- I'm using the component form of the HW equation here: https://www.otexts.org/fpp/7/5\n- I attempted to take the partial derivative of the forecast formula with respect to alpha, beta and gamma\n- These partial derivatives are then used as gradients in a gradient-descent optimizer.\n\nResults are hit or miss.  The optimizer sometimes converges to a legitimate answer, but more often than not gives garbage results.  I've tried the whole gamut of learning rates and have never found a \"sweet spot\", so I don't think the optimizer itself is wrong.\n\nMy current theory is that either my calculus is wrong and the gradients are faulty, or perhaps optimizing parameters in this manner is not a valid approach?  Because the HW formula is technically recursive (it depends on previous values), does that mean I need to continue differentiating down the rabbit hole of previous, dependent values?  Currently I'm just treating the previous values as constants.\n\nI've also read in at least one paper that moving averages are non-convex, so gradient based optimization may fall into a local minimum.  Maybe that's why my results are poor?\n\nSome other options I'm thinking about exploring:\n\n- Finite differencing to approximate the gradients, instead of trying to calculate them by hand\n- [Automatic differencing ala this tutorial](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/mdenil/83c88b7e7f3ff4572a0b)\n- Some blackbox, derivative-free optimizer\n\nAs an aside, the R forecast package seems to use L-BFGS-B with, I think, finite differences (e.g. not specifying a gradient for the `optim` function).\n\nAny tips/pointers would be greatly appreciated!","media":null,"ups":0,"retrieved_on":1440667000,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/3a19z0/holtwinters_parameter_optimization_with_gradient/","post_hint":"self","from":null,"author":"polyfractal","is_self":true,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":1,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t3_3a19z0","archived":false,"id":"3a19z0","score":0,"edited":false,"quarantine":false,"from_id":null,"from_kind":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","created":1434464005,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/3a19z0/holtwinters_parameter_optimization_with_gradient/","secure_media":null,"stickied":false}

I'm working on a solution to the kaggle march madness, and I'm looking for a model with a specific behavior. \n\nGames can be predicted by looking at the nature of a matchup between two teams. When evaluating matchups, its important to look at the play style of the two teams and see how they clash, and the play style of a team is reflected in game stats (across several games for that team). By play style, I mean a team can be highly defensive, offensive, 3 point shooting team, etc. \n\nConsider some sort of a graph model where the nodes are the different teams. Edges between teams would describe the relationship of their matchup (which would be dictated based on the games between those two teams). \n\nWhen it comes time to predict matchups, it could be possible that two teams have never played each other previously. However, one can predict what kind of a matchup these two teams will have based on the matchups of the teams they have played mutually. \n\nFor example, if team A has played team C and team B has played team C. What does this tell us about how team A can play against team B? \n\nThis example can of course be extended to more teams, and a model that can do this is exactly what I'm looking for. **The ability to infer about a matchup by looking at matchups against common teams.** I imagine this would be some sort of a graph structure. \n\nI apologize if my questions are rather vague or maybe flat out wrong.

{"media":null,"selftext":"Hi all, there's a fantastic video that's been floating around of teaching a program how to play Super Mario via neuroevolution.  Check it out here (worth it): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv6UVOQ0F44  Anyway, the narrator gives a basic overview of the neural network involved but I feel like a couple things are left unexplained.  I'm wondering if anyone can shed some light on them.\n\nIn particular, my confusion seems to center around MarI/O's negotiation of obstacles (black squares).  In the video it's mentioned (at least in one instance) that a black square triggers a jump, but I can't imagine this is hard-coded (and doesn't seem to be based on the video).  \n\nBelow I have some hypotheses as to how certain aspects of the learning algorithm work that seemed to be glossed over on the video.  I'd love to hear what everyone's thoughts are on them.\n\n1)  When MarI/O is hit/killed by an object, the program iterates over random possible earlier points to jump until he lands on the ground with a new threshold of fitness (and therefore has successfully negotiated the obstacle).\n\n2)  When he reaches a new fitness level after negotiating an obstacle, his right/left movement is randomized again until he re-discovers how to increase fitness (move right) after jumping.\n\n3)  Once he successfully negotiates an obstacle, he puts this technique in his \"obstacle negotiation bag-o-tricks.\"  Upon seeing another obstacle, he iterates through his learned tricks.  If none work, he resorts to the iterations described in Item 1 to find a new jump-point that will achieve maximum fitness.  Once he finds one that works, he adds it to his memory to try in the future.\n\nFinally, the video never described what constituted a species or genome.  I'm guessing the genome refers to an individual sequence of commands that can be combined randomly to search for fitness gains, a species is a collection of different genomes that randomly combine.  I'm further guessing that genomes cannot combine across different species.  Finally, generation is one iteration of intra-species genome combinations, across all species.  If this is true, I wonder the following: what marks the creation of a new genome within a species and a new species within a generation?\n\nAnyway, if any of the above makes sense, feel free to let me know your thoughts.  If you actually have read the paper on this type of neuroevolution please feel free to give a definitive answer.  If (like me) you haven't but have thoughts about the above assumptions/questions please share those too.

I am wondering what my chances are of ever being able to attend a top 15 ML Ph.D. program given the following:\n\n1. My M.S. thesis involves statistics, signal processing, and a small bit of machine learning. It is good research, not ground-breaking, but it is a novel application of statistical techniques in its particular domain.\n2. I am the primary author on one regional IEEE conference paper, and a secondary author on a national IEEE conference paper. However, neither papers are in the machine learning field. \n3. I am in the final stages of writing the first draft of a stats-heavy signal processing journal article, but its acceptance is far from a guarantee.\n4. My GRE scores were 97% for verbal, 86% for quant., and 80% for writing.\n5. My GPA is a 3.9, and my undergraduate GPA (at the same school) was a 3.28.\n6. My programming work is about 50/50 split between Python and Matlab, and I'm comfortable in both.\n\nI will graduate in May of 2016. I am debating either continuing into Ph.D. straightaway or entering industry for a while. I'm looking to determine how crazy it would be for me to apply for some top ML schools, or if I should save my money, time, and dignity and play it a little more safely.\n\n/r/machinelearning, what are my chances of ever being able to enter an excellent ML graduate program, now or in the future? Are there any steps beside what I've listed that I should be taking at this point to help me achieve this goal? Is there prejudice against applicants who have waited a while to continue on to get their doctorate? I'm assuming next May is my most likely time to get accepted into any form of Ph.D. program, but I'm looking to crowdsource confirmation of my intuition.

I work at an ambulance service and have a dump of 10k ambulance run data (non-HIPAA data) that consists of:\n\n* date/time for dispatch, arrival on scene, departure from scene, arrival at hospital\n* odometer mileage (we bill per mile)\n* incident priority 1 (life threat), 2 (serious), 3 (normal), 4 (no transport)\n* call reason (selection from a pre-populated list)\n* Destination hospital (one of about 6)\n* clinical impression (pp list but different from call reason)\n* age/sex of patient\n\nSo I have two goals.  First, I want to understand some ML tools and how I can properly use them.   Second, and maybe more important, I would love to get some operational insight into our ambulance organization.  That is, I would love to discover some new fact that is hidden in our data that I can use to make an improvement in our service.\n\nObviously we have no control over when 911 will be called.   But we do know that we get 7 calls per day on average, and it is essentially a poisson process.  We \"bin\" the call count per hour and know our peak demand and slow times per day.   Our \"analysis\" is very rudimentary and mostly done with excel.  \n\nI would be interested if anyone has any suggestions for research questions based on this data that are suitable for an ML topic.

Maybe more, maybe less.\n\nSo would it make sense to put all of my parameters in to individual input nodes, and have one output node per parameter that I want to predict?\n\nOr should I train multiple nets, each with a single output node?\n\nMy brain tells me it should be fine, though may require more hidden units. It's entirely possible that my brain is wrong, as I'm afraid I'm neither a doctor nor a data scientist (P &lt; 0.001). Also, it may end up being a recurrent net, depending on the data.

I end up with the conclussion that my model correctly classifies a 90% of data, the real problem here is that most of that data was going to be 0 already (and is correctly labeled as 0), where my goal is to classify correctly the 1's (which only seems to correctly classify about 7% of the label 1 rows)\n\nMy concern here is that maybe I'm missing something, maybe I have to limit the training data in some way that the percentage of 1's and 0's go closer. Does anyone know about this?\n\nThanks in advance","retrieved_on":1440663109,"ups":0,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/3a9hgg/different_sizes_of_labeled_sets/","link_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"Different sizes of labeled sets","subreddit":"MachineLearning","media_embed":{},"author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1434614403","hide_score":false,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","quarantine":false,"score":0,"edited":false,"created":1434618003,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","from_kind":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/3a9hgg/different_sizes_of_labeled_sets/","secure_media":null,"from_id":null,"stickied":false,"author":"krimtheguy","from":null,"is_self":true,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":2,"archived":false,"id":"3a9hgg","link_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t3_3a9hgg","gilded":0}

My background is experimental physics and I have gained basic knowledge about neural networks. \n\nSo I jump right into it.\nGiven a train dataset and a neural network. When training the network it is feed row by row to adjust the weights of the network. For example for row j you have a certain set of activation values throughout the network which yield an output vector which is under some minimization optimal. Next row j+1 is trained which changes again the activation values according to its optimal output. \n\nSo my question is, if you predict the output vector of row j won\u2019t you get a different output vector as previously by the initial training? Or put more general, aren\u2019t rows which are not in some sense orthogonal to each other influencing mutually the result of the network? In that case the outcome of a network is dependent on the order of training. Thus an ensemble of networks trained with a different with a randomized order of the dataset should be more robust than a single one.\n\nI hope there is someone who can shed some light on my simple intuition.","media":null}

Findings in machine learning and mathematics have already been useful to understand how the brain works. For instance, certain dopaminergic neurons have been shown to implement, de-fact, a reinforcement learning protocol in which dopamin corresponds to the \"expected reward\" of an event.  Without such a deep knowledge of machine learning, it would have been harder to understand how OUR software works just using chemistry.\n\nThe way modern neural networks detect images is very similar to the way other living creatures achieve visual understanding. For instance, fruit flies have a hierarchical stratification of neurons in which each one encode a specific feature such as a colour, a movement, a shape, an orientation, etc.\n\nBy looking at the pictures in the recent article [Inceptionism: Going Deeper into Neural Networks](http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html) I cannot stop wondering how similar they look to visual artefacts creates by drugs such as LSD ([example 1](http://i.imgur.com/8Ur6pOr.jpg), [example 2](http://i.imgur.com/fbPqJqE.jpg), [example 3](http://www.zoomquilt.org/)).\n\nIs this just a coincidence, or do you think we are actually getting closer to understand how certain drugs affects the visual cortex?

Kleinberg's theory of stochastic discrimination:\n\n\"An overtraining-resistant stochastic modeling method for pattern recognition\", E.M. Kleinberg, Annals of Statistics, Volume 24, Number 6 (1996), 2319-2349.     \n\nQuoting the Abstract of Kleinberg's paper:\n\"We will introduce a generic approach for solving problems in pattern recognition based on the synthesis of accurate multiclass discriminators from large numbers of very inaccurate 'weak' models through the use of discrete stochastic processes. Contrary to the standard expectation held for the many statistical and heuristic techniques normally associated with the field, a significant feature of this method of 'stochastic modeling' is its resistance to so-called 'overtraining.' The drop in performance of any stochastic model in going from training to test data remains comparable to that of the component weak models from which it is synthesized; and since these component models are very simple, their performance drop is small, resulting in a stochastic model whose performance drop is also small despite its high level of accuracy.\"\n\nThe theory describes an extreme form of ensemble learning;  while many other ensemble learning algorithms can find some explanation under this theory.  The original random decision forest was directly motivated by this theory,  and was specifically designed for the inherent parallelism, the ability to generalize based on subsetting the features, and the uniform discriminative power for the sample space as offered by a tree partition procedure.    More about these in the above mentioned papers.","media":null,"ups":8,"retrieved_on":1440662556,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/3aao2t/the_reason_for_the_effectiveness_of_random/","thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"distinguished":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"The Reason for the Effectiveness of Random Decision Forests","author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1434642384","subreddit":"MachineLearning","media_embed":{},"hide_score":false,"domain":"self.MachineLearning"}

Such inherent coarseness creates two major problems: low unsupervised scalability or very long training necessary for ANNs, and artifacts of recognizing things that obviously aren\u2019t there.\n\nTo resolve these issues, I propose a strictly incremental search. \u201cIncremental\u201d means that comparison must start with minimal-complexity inputs: pixels, and expand with minimal increments in cost of search: distance and derivation. Both increase complexity of discovered patterns, which are then selected as higher-level inputs. The first level of such expansion must be gray-scale cross-comparison between consecutive pixels within horizontal scan line, - something no one else is starting with. \n\nEach level is increment in cost of search projected to discover maximal additive match, where match is defined as lossless compression. It\u2019s a combination of lossless and lossy compression: comparison forms losslessly compressed patterns, and such compression is the criterion for lossy selection of these patterns as a higher-level inputs. This combined compression should make for scalable search: the quantity of inputs on higher levels will decrease maximally faster than their predictive value.\n\nThis is a form of deep learning / hierarchical clustering, increasingly fuzzy on higher levels.

The CNN would be trained to output the high level compact scene descriptor: the camera pose params, and perhaps a small list of a few visible dynamic objects with their own pose params.  Has it been done?\n\nSupervised learning works very well when: 1.) the training objective actually measures/captures our true intentions for the network's future functionality and utility and 2.) the training data distribution is close to the production data distribution (which can be very different than the test distribution, although this problem is not specific to supervised learning).\n\nTraining a deepnet on Imagenet using standard SL results in systems that are really good at the Imagenet benchmark, but this does not directly translate into very general and robust human-level visual performance, partly because of issue #1.\n\nUnsupervised learning is not a panacea - it treats every pattern as equally important and can easily waste huge amounts of computation attempting to learn unimportant noisy details.\n\nIn theory reinforcement learning is a solution - as long as one can translate intended functionality into an appropriate utility function.\n\nHowever in practice just using RL for everything is impractical: there are training complexities due to sparse/infrequent rewards, and having to train every component together is undesirable.\n\nThere are huge advantages to independent modular training: ie vision and other pattern recog systems can be trained on their own datasets, and once perfected those systems can then be integrated as building blocks in larger agents/systems - possibly with retraining.\n\nSo how can we bridge the gap between RL and SL?  The idea is we want to design an objective function such that high performance closely predicts high system utility when later used for various applications.\n\nTo make this idea more concrete, consider the case of a self-driving car.  You could start with a vision system trained on Imagenet and equivalent benchmarks for depth/motion estimation, but the imagenet categories do not really match the discriminations important for the driving task.\n\nSo my modest proposal: use a video game engine as the generative model; use a compressed high level 3D scene descriptor as the training criteria for the vision system.\n\nAs Hinton said - vision is the inverse of graphics.  Video game engines are very powerful generative models; an enormous amount of work has gone into carving reality at the joints in just the right way, using all the clever approximations, etc.  \n\nSo we know, *a priori*, that a (suitably compressed) version of the high level 3D scene descriptor used in a photoreal graphics engine is more or less a good generic goal representation for vision: because we have a generative model that can render photoreal images starting from that compact descriptor (and using reasonable amounts of computation).  This can automatically prevent the network from learning unimportant noisy details - as those are generated procedurally from stochastic noise during rendering.\n\nNow I realize there is a body of existing work on learning generative models, but this would be different - using an existing graphics engine as the generative model.\n\nDomain adversarial training could be used (if necessary) to force the network to generalize well between virtual and real images.\n\nHas anyone trained a CNN like this?  This is an avenue of research I am interested in exploring.  I realize that it may require large amounts of compute and or data - but of course using a video game engine also more or less completely solves the data issue.","id":"3ajdcw","archived":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"name":"t3_3ajdcw","saved":false,"over_18":false,"num_comments":8,"author_flair_css_class":null,"is_self":true,"author":"jcannell","from":null,"stickied":false,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/3ajdcw/utilitarian_learning_in_virtual_environments/","secure_media":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","created":1434832596,"from_kind":null,"from_id":null,"quarantine":false,"edited":1434837440,"score":4}

This paper considers using samples from the network as inputs at test time with a probability that increases as training progresses.  They justify this as a curriculum learning approach, as learning with the network's samples as input is harder than using the observed values.  \n\nHowever, I think that the method is wrong, at least if one wants to maintain a probabilistic interpretation of the model.  I'll first present an example of where it would fail and then I'll provide an explanation.  \n\nSuppose the first element in a sequence is drawn from a uniform distribution U(0,100).  Each following element is equal to the last element minus one.  Now suppose we let the RNN use its own samples as input for the first 10 steps and uses observed values for the next 10 steps.  Since the model hasn't seen any of the observed sequence yet, it basically has to guess the value that the sequence will start at.  After the first 10 steps, it starts receiving input from the true distribution, which could be completely inconsistent with what the model sampled.  So to give a more concrete example, the samples could be 20,19,18,17,16,15, and then the observed values following it could be 100,99,98,97,96,95.  This means that the model is seeing a historical sequence that could not be drawn from the data distribution.  Essentially it means that the model is learning the wrong conditional distribution, even late in training.  \n\nI think that one should pick a point in the series, and use observed values before that point and use sampled values after that point.  I think that this method is more sound.

The code itself has no 'errors' or apparent flaws. Nevertheless, it is not learning -- the more I train it does not change its ability to predict the testing data. The following is information about what I've done, please ask me to update this post if I left something important out.\n\nI wrote the neural network and tested it on several different problems to make sure that the network itself worked. I trained it to learn how to double numbers, XOR, cube numbers, and learn the sin function to a decent accuracy. So, I'm fairly confident that the actual algorithm is working.\n\nThe network using using the sigmoid activation function. The learning rate is .3, Momentum is .6. The weights are initialized to rng.nextFloat() -.5) * 4\n\nI then got the Brown Corpus data-set and simplified the tagset to 'universal' with NLTK. I used NLTK for generating and saving all the corpus and dictionary data. I cut the last 15,000 sentences out of the corpus for testing purposes. I used the rest of the corpus (about 40,000 sentences of tagged words) for training.\n\nThe neural network layout is as follows: There is an input neuron for each Tag. Output Layer: There is one output neuron for each tag. The network is taking inputs for 3 words: first: the word coming before the word we want to tag, second: the word that needs to be tagged, third: the word that follows the second word. So, total number of inputs are 3x(total number of possible tags). The input values are numbers between 0 and 1. Each of the 3 words being fed into the input layer is searched for in a dictionary (made up by the 40,000 corpus, the same corpus that is used for training). The dictionary holds the number of times that each word has been tagged in the corpus as what part of speech.\n\n    For instance, the word 'cover' is tagged as a noun 1 time and a verb 3 times.\n\nPercentages of being tagged are computed for each part of speech that the word is associated as, and this is what is fed into the network for that particular word. So, the input neuron designated as NOUN would receive .33 and VERB would receive .66. The other input neurons that hold tags for that word receive an input of 0.0. This is done for each of the 3 words to be inputted. If a word is the first word of a sentence, the first group of tags are all 0. If a word is the last word of a sentence, the final group of input neurons that hold the tag probabilities for the following word are left as 0s. I've been using 10 hidden nodes (I've read a number of papers and this seems to be a good place to start testing with)\n\nNone of the 15,000 testing sentences were used to make the 'dictionary.' So, when testing the network with this partial corpus there will be some words the network has never seen. Words that are not recognized have their suffix stripped, and their suffix is searched for in another 'dictionary.' Whatever is most probable for that word is then used as inputs for it.\n\nThis is my set-up, and I started trying to train the network. I've been training the network with all 40,000 sentences. 1 epoch = 1 forward and backpropagation of every word in each sentence of the 40,000 training-set. So, just doing 1 epoch takes quite a few seconds. Just by knowing the word probabilities the network did pretty well, but the more I train it, nothing happens. The numbers that follow the epochs are the number of correctly tagged words divided by the total number of words.\n\nFirst run 50 epochs: 0.928218786\n\n100 epochs: 0.933130661\n\n500 epochs: 0.928614499 took around 30 minutes to train this\n\nTried 10 epochs: 0.928953683\n\nUsing only 1 epoch had results that pretty much varied between .92 and .93\n\nSo, it doesn't appear to be working...\n\nI then took 55 sentences from the corpus and used the same dictionary that had probabilities for all 40,000 words. For this one, I trained it in the same way I trained my XOR -- I only used those 55 sentences and I only tested the trained network weights on those 55 sentences. The network was able to learn those 55 sentences quite easily. With 120 epochs (taking a couple seconds) the network went from tagging 3768 incorrectly and 56 correctly (on the first few epochs) to tagging 3772 correctly and 52 incorrectly on the 120th epoch.\n\nThis is where I'm at, I've been trying to debug this for over a day now, and haven't figured anything out.\n","retrieved_on":1440657218,"ups":2}

My hypothesis was that the evolutionary algorithms could figure out on their own whether to use convolutions or feed-back loops. The way I achieve feedback is to recalculate new state of the network for all but input neurons using previous state as an input to the network, repeat as many times as there are non-input neurons.

As usual, this is probably obvious but perhaps I'm too close to the problem to see what's going wrong here. \n\nI have a set of predictors and outcomes, rateDat and goal, respectively.

Rather than using cvpartition to generate a partitioning scheme, I fit individual models using all data but one example (i.e., manual leave one out), then check for each model whether it accurately predicts the one that's left out.

However, after running the agent for two to three days straight, it seems to play no more intelligently than an untrained version.\n\nHere are the steps I took ([source](http://superintelligence.ch/deepmind/)):\n\n1. Cloned https://github.com/soumith/deepmind-atari. I'm using this fork because it provides a fix for compatibility with changes to the Torch nn library.\n1. Changed `../torch/bin/luajit train_agent.lua $args` to `../torch/bin/qlua train_agent.lua $args` in run_gpu.\n1. Changed `display=false` to `display=true` in `torch/share/lua/5.1/alewrap/AleEnv.lua`\n1. Ran `./run_gpu breakout` for two to three days. This produced the network file dqn/DQN3_0_1_breakout_FULL_Y.t7.\n1. Changed `netfile=\"\\\"convnet_atari3\\\"\"` in run_gpu to `netfile=\"\\\"DQN3_0_1_breakout_FULL_Y.t7\\\"\"`.\n\nMy machine reached approximately 12 million steps. Maybe this is not enough?\n\nI'm concerned that the changes introduced with https://github.com/soumith/deepmind-atari/commit/88fffeaa04724d1b34f2586f8fc08ebc44256cb0 may have broken this demo. Is this at all possible? Does anyone have any suggestions on what might be wrong? I greatly appreciate any input and would really like to get this working!\n\n**EDIT**: I figured out how to make this work. Basically I reverted change 88fffea (in deepmind-atari) and then used forked versions of cunn, cutorch, torch7, and nn. I then reverted changes to these dependencies, removing changes after April 6, 2015, as change 88fffea (in deepmind-atari) occurred on April 7, 2015, and I modified install_dependencies.sh to install the dependencies from local directories.

{"media":null,"selftext":"Hi guys,\n\nI have problems to fully understand the concept (and functionality) of non-parametric modeling, where only the data is given.\n\nAccording to the information I have found so far, the goal is to estimate a density function (is this correct?). It does so by using different methods such as calculating a histogram, which can't be continuous, though. Therefore, there was another method presented in our lecture - the concept of Kernel density estimation. Moreover, also Dirac delta functions were mentioned in this context.\nUnfortunately, I am not studying math and thus have some difficulties to understand how the Kernel density estimation really works. Does anyone know an intuitive explanation on this topic?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAlso, are following concepts considered being part of non-parametric modeling:\n\n- EM algorithm and k-Means (I think no, because we introduce parameters)\n- k-NN (I think yes, because we are working without parameters here)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nRegards and thanks for your effort!\n","retrieved_on":1440654629,"ups":1,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/3arekv/please_help_me_understand_nonparametric_modeling/","link_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","title":"Please help me understand Non-Parametric Modeling","secure_media_embed":{},"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"MachineLearning","created_utc":"1435011044","author_flair_text":null,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","hide_score":false,"quarantine":false,"edited":false,"score":1,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/3arekv/please_help_me_understand_nonparametric_modeling/","secure_media":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","from_kind":null,"created":1435014644,"from_id":null,"stickied":false,"author":"Afritus","from":null,"is_self":true,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"num_comments":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"id":"3arekv","archived":false,"gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t3_3arekv"}

As this interviews are time consuming, a small amount of interviews only pretends to actually survey people and fake the data instead. Some of them got caught and this is why a labeled dataset for subsequent waves of this study exists.\n\nThe basic idea therefore is to detect the fake interviews by machine learning. There are some problems though:\n\n- classes are extremely imbalanced (at max 2% fakers per wave).\n- Some Fakers did only fake 1 interview (not a lot data available)\n- The questions between the waves vary quite a bit, so it is not easy to construct universal features.\n\nMy current approach (based on literature for this topic) is: \n1. Pooling all Interviews, so that each Interviewer in a wave is one row.\n2. Using Benford's Law to detect differences between expected digit distributions and observed digit distributions\n3. Combining data for 2 (out of 4 waves), using synthetic sampling (SMOTE + ENN) to generate better class balance for classification\n4. Training a model on the two waves (using grid search with cross validation to optimize paramers and then testing on the last two waves.\n\nI tried several models and the results were okay, but not amazing.\n\nDo you have any ideas for maybe better solutions for this problem?

I'm really not sure but I feel like this may be a good choice despite the lack of recommendations on the card(its a brand new card). The main reason I am strongly considering this as my card is because it gives me lots of memory which sounds like would be needed in implementing things like convolutional networks.\n\nOther possible options would be nvidia and amd cards around the same price range (give or take ~$100) as far as the computer is concerned.

I'm also going to try a normal feed-forward NN network and Random Forests with 'flattened' inputs, (where I take long data over time for a patient, and condense it into wide data containing n - some time period observations, along with new features based on those condensed time periods.)\n\nIs there anything else you would recommend trying out?

I might have some idea but I would like some feedback about this first. Not so long ago, I wrote a controller for this contest : https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/44707/lab-rat-race-an-exercise-in-genetic-algorithms that can be found here : https://github.com/matovitch/Ratlab-. And I have been thinking to extend the concept of this \"game\".\n\nThe idea would be, with the help of the players, to create a virtual ecosystem. The world for this ecosystem to thrive in would be a 2d procedurally generated grid-based map of various dirt and sea with a torus geometry to avoid edges problems. Each player would have to chose a race with a predefined attack strategy (to be determined). He will then have to code the behaviour of one species of that race for one turn of the game in a very specific virtual machine. This machine will have 3 different memories : visual, genetic, neural (and a stack). The visual memory would be a read-only memory of the surrounding cells of an individual. The genetic one is also read only and would be given as an input to an individual by the simulation which will perform the breading process. The neural one will be scrambled at each individual birth, but from the player perspective he could use it as he wants. The aims of the player code will be to fill 3 registers that will determine the magnitude and direction of the next \"acceleration\" vector for the individual and the attack vs do-not-attack on the next turn (attack should have an associated penalty cost to avoid always-attack strategy). The simulation would adjust the attack damage points for each species to keep a balanced ecosystems so that even the badly-written species could survive. Additonally, the virtual machine would include two read-only \"health\" and \"age\" registers.\n\nAfter that, one could stream the data of the simulation to a G/WUI client and have some fun watching at its own species fight to survive. (one could associate color palette to a species and use the hash of the \"kernel\" code as a seed for procedural skin generation per species (or dna)...but back to reality).\n\nI have thought more in depth to the architecture of the virtual machine (including \"vectorized\" instruction for linear algebra).\n\nI thinks that could be pretty fun but I can see a few drawbacks. First, it's being sunny outside and I am lucky enough to live in a really nice area vs. this seems like a *lot* of work. Second, it's more a design question, why a virtual machine...why not a simple protocol with the players as clients ? Each player could chose its language as he wants, use existing libraries. Well the game would become asynchronous, and quite unfair regarding latency, memory or computing power (as high frequecy trading ;)), a \"cheater\" could use the stream of the simulation as input data (for info on the map even if we impose a broadcast delay)...but I thought I had some stronger arguments against it I can't remember so this may be a viable option ? Then a lot of people in machine learning mostly use higher level language like python, R, Julia, (even last C++). So a very specific RISC assembly might frighten even the bravest to participate. One could create some DSL C-like language but that at least double the effort.\n\nI would be very glad if you could reframe my thoughts. What' s the easiest? What's the funniest ?\n\nThanks in advance for your help. Best Regards,\n\np.s : Sorry for the raw formatting and probably for my deficient english...the explanations might not be perfect either feel free to ask if you have any doubt.","archived":false,"id":"3b7uyt","name":"t3_3b7uyt","link_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"num_comments":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"is_self":true,"author":"[deleted]","from":null,"stickied":false,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/3b7uyt/about_an_idea_for_a_side_project/","secure_media":null,"from_kind":null,"created":1435344952,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","from_id":null,"quarantine":false,"score":0,"edited":1435342872}

[My data was not normalized](http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/3bbijy/why_is_a_simple_logistic_regression_model/cskoc6u), which was apparently a big mistake. After normalizing the data, not only did the scikit-learn implementation of logistic regression shoot up to an accuracy of 74%, but the neural net achieved an accuracy of 76% after merely seconds of training. I feel pretty embarrassed that the solution was so simple, but I kind of suspected that might be the case. Thanks a lot for being so helpful /r/MachineLearning. I really love this subreddit and I feel like I've learned so much from it.\n\n**Edit #3**: Some additional discussion on feature normalization.\n\n* http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/41704/how-and-why-do-normalization-and-feature-scaling-work\n* http://www.quora.com/How-does-normalization-of-data-help-in-Machine-Learning\n\n**Edit #4**: In case anyone comes across this post in the future, I think I must have had a bug in my original code, or something screwy was going on, because the neural net started underperforming again relative to the R logistic regression model, but upon switching back to unnormalized data, the deep net was again able to outperform the R model. My suggestion would be to experiment with both (which seems to be good advice for most things in machine learning).\n\n*****\n\nI'm trying to build a classifier for some data that has two classes. The data consists of ~300,000 examples with 47 features, of which 18 are binary (representing one-hot encodings of two categorical features with five and 13 categories, respectively) and the rest are real valued. The data is very sparse and the class split is 55/45.\n\nRunning this data through a logistic regression model in R (using glm) achieves an accuracy of ~74% on the test set in a matter of seconds. Oddly, scikit-learn\u2019s implementation of logistic regression consistently performs worse than R\u2019s, hovering around ~70-71% accuracy. Some googling led me to [this recent post on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28747019/comparison-of-r-statmodels-sklearn-for-a-classification-task-with-logistic-reg), which, unfortunately, doesn\u2019t have any answers. I feel like this discrepency could potentially be relevant to the accuracy of my neural nets, but I\u2019m not sure.\n\nMoving on, the various nets I've attempted to train (using both Theano and Torch implementations) consistently top out at around ~71% accuracy. I've tried using models of varying complexity (single hidden layer with few units, single hidden layer with more units [e.g., 500], and two or three hidden layers with varying numbers of units), and with various learning rates and mini batch sizes, but I can't seem to break past that ~71% wall (though these models do always end up surpassing the logistic regression model, albeit not by much).\n\nI know that, in theory, the neural nets should be able to at least match the accuracy of the logistic regression classifiers, so what's happening? I'd be happy with overfitting the model at this point (I haven't even been applying any regularization to the cost functions), so what steps could I take to guarantee that? I\u2019ve also come across [this post on Stack Overflow](http://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/731/how-to-fight-underfitting-in-a-deep-neural-net) discussing underfitting neural nets, but, even after following that advice, my nets still are only able to match the accuracy of the scikit-learn logistic regression model, not the one implemented in R.\n\n**Edit #1**: Thanks for your feedback, everyone. I think I may have omitted a key detail here that might be leading people astray... **the training error is also topping out at ~71%**. My understanding is that neural nets should basically be able to \"memorize\" the training set as they are made more complex, but that is not happening here, which is why I think something screwy is going on. As /u/mostly_reasonable pointed out, I'm pretty sure this data set is \"noisy\" in that 100% accuracy on the training set probably isn't possible, but the R logistic regression model consistently achieves ~74% accuracy on different training/testing sets, so the neural net has not yet reached the theoretical maximum.","domain":"self.MachineLearning","hide_score":false,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"MachineLearning","created_utc":"1435425184","author_flair_text":null,"preview":{"images":[{"variants":{},"resolutions":[{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/Na1KPWKNVl6scgS9nIHq6TItzmZ7AAjzi2AE8ocRNSc.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=656f34a961b255155ecd891f29ce769d","width":108,"height":108},{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/Na1KPWKNVl6scgS9nIHq6TItzmZ7AAjzi2AE8ocRNSc.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=6ce510abeee6ac678d273da1d06f5def","height":216,"width":216}],"source":{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/Na1KPWKNVl6scgS9nIHq6TItzmZ7AAjzi2AE8ocRNSc.jpg?s=f8dd953753edb7698bb7c421ff04b05f","width":316,"height":316},"id":"63C1GbYQbI4tHZMkw99e-qlyoYaGnG58yfnmnFUJ34s"}]},"title":"Why is a simple logistic regression model outperforming my neural nets?","secure_media_embed":{},"distinguished":null,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self"}

We are showing multiple films at the same time and we want a ML algorithm to come up with a schedule for which screen should show which film and also predict how many ticket/popcorn desks should be open before the show. \n\nTo clarify, the screening rooms have different capacities, pictures have different durations and patrons may behave differently based on which demographic the film targets, etc. \n\nThe algorithm could be fed any kind of data to improve it's predictions, such as IMDB rating, genre of film, reviews, film launches, maybe weather as well as past performance in the real world. Also, the algorithm should be able to learn from operator input (for example the operator would prefer to open screening rooms that are close to each other for easier staffing or close down rooms for refurbishment).\n\nThe objective of the algorithm would be to produce a daily schedule for the multiplex, allocating each picture to a room and predicting how long ahead of time should the ticket and popcorn tills be opened in order to ensure that no patrons queue for more than X minutes while also making sure that no staff is sitting idle (multiple tills can be opened at different times).\n\nDo you think this would be a suitable problem for ML? What would be your recommended approach to this problem? I'm thinking about neural networks with some form of evolution. \n\nThe idea is that a sufficiently evolved algorithm would be able to find interesting correlations (let's say for example that certain genres of pictures attract demographics that prefer to pay cash, making the ticket sales a longer process or during winter time patrons arrive earlier at the cinema, etc). \n\n\nNote that this is a hypothetical problem (and I know very little about the film business) however I feel that a solution would be applicable to any resource allocation problem where humans are involved (market checkout, festival security lanes and food stands, etc).\n\nThanks for any pointers.\n\n\n","permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/3bik7w/resource_allocation_and_optimization_with_ml/","link_flair_text":null}
