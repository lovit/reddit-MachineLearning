I think it might be a time series or regression problem, but not sure how to proceed. It also seems sort of similar to gene sequence problems.\n\nI have 10 continuous variables, which in unison each give a sequence of 100 values (real numbers within a typical range). I also have some categorical variables that describe the setup. At the end of the sequences, there is a single outcome for the whole set, which is a single real number. I have about 20,000 sets (10 sequences of 100 + categorical variables + overall outcome).\n\nAny suggestions on how I would do the following:\n\n1) Predict the overall outcome, based on the 10 sequences and categorical variables. Would this be some sort of regression? Most importantly, what kinds of features do I extract from the 10 sequences for use in a regression model?\n\n2) How do I include the categorical values describing the setup of each set, as well as the 10 numerical sequences?\n\n3) Determine how much of the sequences do I need to see, before I can reliably predict the overall outcome? For example, \"after seeing the first 20% of the sequences, I can predict the outcome\". This would enable early response.\n\n4) How do I determine what is the \"signature\" of sequences that result in high or low overall outcome? For example, high values in the first 10% of variable 1 combined with low values in last 10% of variable 2 results in very high outcome. This ties into my question about what features to extract from the 10 sequences.\n\nThanks very much for any suggestions on how to tackle this!

So, this is my first foray into SVM and I've been studying Learning With Kernels while trying to implement SVM on some of my own data.   I have some questions about some of the Matlab functions used to fit the models and was hoping someone could provide some insight. \n\nI'm using fitcsvm for a two-class problem.  I'm using a polynomial kernel, am trying to optimize the parameters for BoxConstraint and KernelScale simultaneously, and am evaluating the generalizability of the model using leave one out cross validation.  (Note: in reality this is a biological problem and I want to see how well the firing rates of ensembles of neurons differentiate certain behavioral states, so my terminology might seem off as some of it reflects more so the question and perhaps less so the standard nomenclature used in the machine learning world).  \n\nThe default solver for matlab's fitcsvm() is SMO.  This seems to work fine, but there's also the option of using the L1Qp solver, which uses a quadratic programming algorithm to implement L1 soft-margin minimization.  When I use L1Qp with parallel enabled this uses about 12 of my cores (I'm using a 32 core machine) and takes about twice as long as the SMO algorithm; this is less than desirable because my optimization already takes a few hours with SMO.  Furthermore the minimum found with L1Qp isn't necessarily better than what's found with SMO, but I haven't been able to rigorously test this.  \n\nSo, my question is: what are the benefits of using L1Qp? \n\nA second question is: what is matlab doing to the Kernel via the KernelScale argument pair? In the documentation it says it divides the kernel by the kernel scale elementwise and then applies the 'appropriate kernel norm'.

But more importantly, while modified images fool all three ImageNet convnets (Berkeley CaffeNet 2012, Oxford CNN-S 2013, Oxford VeryDeep-19 2014), modifying image to fool one was not enough to change opinion about image of the other two convnets. And modifying modified image again, so it would fool two out of three convnets was still not enough to persuade third one to misclassify image.  \n\n* I used the very first three images I could find that were correctly classified by all three networks(daisy, jay, agaric). \n\n* Second step I generated adversarial image that was classified as ostrich by Oxford VeryDeep-19. VeryDeep-19 was chosen as most advanced/newest net.\n\n* Check if classification of the other two nets have changed. No, in all three cases the other two nets were correctly classifying images as being daisy, jay and agaric.\n\n* Create adversarial image of adversarial one generated on previous step but now using Oxford CNN-S 2013(second most advanced net), again adjusting image so CNN would classify it as being ostrich.\n\n* Check if classification of the last nets have changed. No, in all three cases CaffeNet was still able to correctly classify images as being daisy, jay and agaric.\n \n* Create adversarial image of adversarial one generated on previous step but now using CaffeNet, again so it would see ostrich in it. And this is the pictures that you see in the right column.\n\nThis is first 3 random images I tried. The demo is slow plus CAPTCHA protected. And sometimes convnets were not able to agree among themselves about image, nvm misclassification error rate for top1 result.\n\nPossible explanation, original work (\"intriguing properties\") was done on much simpler dataset(CIFAR), but large convnets on ImageNet were forced to come up with more feature that distinguish between 1000 classes. And being big they probably come up with different features. At least it looks like being the case for ostrich classifier.

In his lecture he suggested that using a training/validation/test was better than just using cross-validation to determine which model to use. I can definitely see how using CV can lead to an overly optimistic error estimation. I was wondering if in practice the two are combined.\n\nFor instance, why not perform k-fold cross-validation on the training/validation set. Then once the model is selected, use the test set to estimate the final error. This also leads to the possibility of instead repeating the entire training/validation/test process multiple times. My only concern with using the training/validation/set once, is that there is a chance the samples chosen are bad. Therefore running it multiple times, a better estimate of the error can be found.

After submitting some search terms to Google Scholar, I saw that those terms are being used interchangeably in literature. \nPlease let's discuss and clarify!\n\nBased on my understanding now, statisticians use the term parametric in context of making assumptions about the distribution the samples have been drawn from. In contrast to ML where we use it to distinguish between the relation of training samples and assumptions.\n\nSome examples:\n\nI think \"naive Bayes\" classifiers are obviously parametric! E.g., in the Gaussian case have the mean and SD. Being a generative model, I think there is no argument about that from both sides. In terms of \"statistics,\" this would be parametric. And furthermore, this also doesn't have anything to do with our training samples.\n\nAnother easy one: k-nearest neighbor classifiers. Here, we don't make any assumptions about the distribution, however, being a lazy learner, our parameters do depend on the training data. Same for SVM.\n\nBut what about perceptrons now? Using the ML definition, I would say it is parametric, however, in terms of \"statistics,\" we don't model the joint probabilities here... \n\nI am looking forward to hear your opinion on this \"issue.\"","media":null,"hide_score":false,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1423542785","subreddit":"MachineLearning","media_embed":{},"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"Definitions of \"Parametric\" vs. \"Non-parametric\" in ML and statistics - Let's get it straight","thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"distinguished":null,"stickied":false,"from_id":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","from_kind":null,"created":1423542785,"secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/2vducn/definitions_of_parametric_vs_nonparametric_in_ml/","score":5,"edited":1423543314,"quarantine":false,"name":"t3_2vducn","link_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"archived":true,"id":"2vducn","num_comments":11,"author_flair_css_class":null,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"is_self":true,"from":null,"author":"rasbt"}

I am looking at a sliding window of the last second of data and using the mean and standard deviation of both acceleration and angular velocity in x, y, and z axes as the features (so 12 total).\n\nRight now I collect calibration data by getting the user to perform the action 5 times and then calculating the mean and standard deviation of each of the 12 features for those measurements. \n\nFor testing, every time I get a new reading from the sensor I compute the 12 features for the last second of data and compare that with the calibration numbers.  I started out by calculating the ((current reading - calibration average)/calibration stdev)^2 for each feature and if the average for all features was below a threshold that I set empirically I classified it as the gesture I was looking for.  I've found that this can perform well if calibrated well but differences in how consistently the calibration actions are performed cause the calibration stdevs to change which requires the classification threshold to need to change too.  \n\nI started looking into Naive Bayes classifiers because I realized that that was pretty close to what I was doing.  I replaced the calculation above with calculating the probability density for each feature and then summing their logs to get most of the posterior numerator.  What I don't have is the probability that this gesture is occurring or the posterior numerators of any other gestures to compare this to.  If I just compare the sum of the logs of the probability densities to an empirical threshold it works pretty similar to what I was getting before. \n\nI guess what I'm trying to figure out is how to get a Naive Bayes classifier (or similar) to classify if one action is happening or not, instead of choosing the best fit between multiple classes.  I could try to provide data for other actions that would be negative results but I'm not sure how I would go about doing this since I need to differentiate the desired action from any random motion.\n\nI'm new to machine learning so any suggestions on how to get my classifier more consistent, any other classifiers I should try, or ideas on how I could improve my overall process would be greatly appreciated!","media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/2vh62z/gesture_recognition_using_accelerometer_and/"}

He asked me to explain topic models, which I mention on my resume.  He had a general understanding of machine learning but told me that he hadn't ever witnessed the Bayesian side of things.\n\nMy explanation was rather poor, and it was hard for me to explain both LDA and Bayesian modeling / modeling with PGMs in such a short amount of time.  To most people without a technical background, they're satisfied if I say that LDA yields list of salient groups of related words over a collection, with documents represented as a mixture of these groups.\n\nThe interviewer, however, familiar with simpler indexing schemes, asked me genuinely what the difference is between LDA and tf/idf indexing, for example.  The best I could come up with is that \n\nAfter this experience, I realize that although I understand certain machine learning algorithms on a technical level, I need to work on my intuitive understanding of what they accomplish.\n\nLooking back at the original LDA paper, the only explanation is the following:\n\n&gt; While the tf-idf reduction has some appealing features\u2014notably in its basic identification of sets of words that are discriminative for documents in the collection\u2014the approach also provides a relatively small amount of reduction in description length and reveals little in the way of inter- or intradocument statistical structure.\n\nReddit, how would you answer this question?

I have never done any NLP before. Things went pretty well in the beginning but now I'm stuck. I found the Word2Vec algorithm to convert words into fixed length feature vectors. From there, there seem to be multiple ways to handle variable length data.\n\n1. Histogram / Bag of words / Averaging feature vectors: I don't think this will work, since the order of words is very important.\n2. Combining all word vectors in a sentence feature vector. (And classify that vector). Problem: I could not find an algorithm to that.\n3. Recursive neural networks. This would be nice, because it is possible to use the 'syntax tree' of a sentence, which removes something the network should learn. Problem: I don't know how to train them. (Minibatch)SGD seems to be the right (or at least a working) algorithm here, but I don't know how to express the cost/loss function for such a network.\n4.  Recurrent neural networks, feeding the word vectors over time. Same problem: I don't know how to train them.\n5. Convolutional neural networks??...\n\nI'm stuck here. My knowledge is limited, and I need to choose one of these.\nCould someone tell which method is the easiest/gives the best results or some pointers on the problems I'm having?\nI'll be happy with any kind of information.\n\n// Another problem I have is that Word2Vec is sometimes unable to find correlations on large amounts of data.

(SGD would do **much better**, as long as the learning rate is between 0.01 and 0.99) With the noise on, |x| asymptotes at 0.026. This is definitely an improvement, but is this now implemented as intended?\n\n**Edit 2:** The order in which the averages are calculated is probably important, unless `tau` is quite big, but we know it's not always big, because it's meant to be reset to `2.2` sometimes (why not `2`?). However, this order is not specified.\n\n**Edit 3:** `epsilon = 1e-5` improves things, but it's starting to look like a hyperparameter","media":null,"ups":19,"retrieved_on":1440902765,"author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1424161818","subreddit":"MachineLearning","media_embed":{},"hide_score":false,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"distinguished":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"Ask ML: has anyone tried to reproduce ADASECANT?"}

The obsession with what I call the 'marginally state-of-the-art'. It's become particularly bad with deep learning because of all the hyperparameters available to tune.\n\n&gt; As a practitioner, this is extremely frustrating. Papers pushing complicated augmentations to standard methods keep using the word 'outperform' for results that OBVIOUSLY lie within the variance caused by the hyperparameters. This is both dishonest and a disservice to the larger machine learning community. And it's getting worse if you look at the neural network papers submitted to NIPS, ICML, ICLR. If you look at the reviews of ICLR, at best this issue is being completely ignored and at worst this sort of misleading progress is encouraged.\n\n&gt; Do no misunderstand what I say, I believe classification performance and other measures are extremely important, but not when the increase is so marginal. Researchers should be simplifying their methods and getting competitive performance. This is where real progress happens.\n\nSince so many researchers are guilty of it (take a look at most of the papers posted here in the past few weeks), I wanted to hear their side of the argument.","media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/2wk8yi/discuss_the_elephant_in_the_room_of_machine/"}

Butterflies are coming in specific time, they are feeding from these flowers, when butterflies come to place **x** in our farming area, they are looking for flower **Y** some of the flowers are already occupied, and some times, the whole flowers are all occupied, so they leave or go to other places looking for another flower in another place.

For the fully connected case, where is the normalization process done?  The paper infers it's at the 'layer inputs', which I've interpretted as before the linear transform, but later states in the convolutional case that it's done in between the linear and non linear transforms.  Similarly, ZCA whitening is done as a preprocessing step, lending weight to the 'layer inputs' idea.\n\n2. Is the m/(m-1) really needed in this case?  Given a large enough batch size, does it actually have a sizable impact?\n\n3. Anyone have a sense of what they're using for the numerical constant?  I'm dumping in 1e-6 since I took that as avoiding the divide by zero problem.\n\n4. For convolutional filters, I can't tell whether they're batch normalizing all the channels together once, independent of number of output channels, or if they're normalizing once per filter.\n\nEmpirically, adding batch normalization prior to the linear transformations have yielded better results than sandwiched between the linear and nonlinear transforms, but both have peformed worse and trained slower than without it.

The approach they used was to scrape the top 100 results for a set of random keywords, grab about 17 \"known\" ranking factors (such as Page Rank, keyword in URL, domain age, etc), then use that data along with a **pairwise linear programming ranking model** and a **recursive partitioning ranking algorithm** to then predict which of those 100 results are in the top 10. This is all trained against the actual Google rankings.\n\nNow, I understand conceptually what is happening, such as pairwise ranking and recursive partitioning, but what I can't figure out (and this could just be my incredibly naive understanding of research papers) is how to actually reproduce this algorithm with my own code. Is all the information I need to reproduce this algorithm even contained within this paper and I just can't put it all together? Or is this more of an overview of what the researchers did and the algorithm is actually secret?\n\nAnd in the latter case, is it possible/normal for someone to reach out to the researchers and ask them for more details of their implementation? Or is that a no-no?\n\nSorry for what is probably a very simple question, but I've reached a dead end and figured you guys might be able to help.

I'll try to be quick:\n\nMy task was to classify offers from an online trading website into 10 categories. About 90% of training data had label 0 (offer does not violate website's terms). I was training my model for Balanced Accuracy metric.\n\nEach example had a few dense features (when the offer was added etc.) and text features: description + attributes. 1 million training examples, 1kk testing.\n\nI was working with **scikit-learn**.\n\n**--------**\n\nI used cross-validation (really safe one: 5-fold, training on 65% of the training set). The results were great: balanced Accuracy of about ~70% on the validation set. My model was predicting label 0 in something around ~85% of validation examples.\n\nAnd then I used the model on the test data: it predicted label 0 for 98% of examples and scored 30% on the hidden test-set. \n\nI then used a Naive Bayes classifier -- it achieved validation accuracy of around 60% and again predicted the label 0 in almost right amount. Then I used in on the testing data and... it predicted label 0 in 30% of the test examples, which is clearly a nonsense. I didn't check the model on the test set, because I was leaving the country and the competition deadline passed in the meantime. \n\nLastly I used Vowpal Wabbit - it did as poorly as sklearn.\n\n**--------**\n\nSo here's my actual question:\n\nHow does one approach a situation in which something goes as bad as in the case above? There is no reason to think that test and training sets had different label distributions. Also, as far as I can tell, words (from the top 3000 bag) occurred with the same frequencies in both sets.\n\nIs there any way in which I can check why my models behave in such a weird way? Is there anything I can do to discover if I have a bug in the code, or the test and training sets are truly different? And can I discover in what way they differ to train my model appropriately? Or I should simply abandon cross-validation and validate my models directly on the test set (which fails if I'm allowed to do, say, 1 submission per day and there are 62 hours left ;) ). \n\n**--------**\n\nThanks in advance for any help!!!","media":null,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","hide_score":false,"created_utc":"1424993566","author_flair_text":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"MachineLearning","title":"When cross-validation goes wrong: model inspection in scikit-learn","secure_media_embed":{},"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","distinguished":null}

It's a simple feedforward network with two hidden layers, it defeats me and other minmax AIs almost every time, and even manages to not suck that much against\na perfect player. It was trained with TD(\u03bb) through self-play and games against a perfect player (~10^7 games in total). It's input consists of the raw board encoding and some high-level features like \"the opponent is able to close a mill\" and \"we have only 3 men left\". It's output is the predicted value of the state from the point of view of the player to move, i.e., move selection is done by showing it every possible after-state and selecting the one that's best for us.\n\n**The problem:**  \nThere are up to 16 symmetric boards (rotated, mirrored etc.) that - for the outcome of the game - are exactly the same.

He has pioneered self-improving general problem solvers since 1987, and Deep Learning Neural Networks (NNs) since 1991. The recurrent NNs (RNNs) developed by his research groups at the Swiss AI Lab IDSIA (USI &amp; SUPSI) &amp; TU Munich were the first RNNs to win official international contests. They recently helped to improve connected handwriting recognition, speech recognition, machine translation,  optical character recognition, image caption generation, and are now in use at Google, Microsoft, IBM, Baidu, and many other companies. IDSIA's Deep Learners were also the first to win object detection and image segmentation contests, and achieved the world's first superhuman visual classification results, winning nine international competitions in machine learning &amp; pattern recognition (more than any other team).  They also were the first to learn control policies directly from high-dimensional sensory input using reinforcement learning. His research group also established the field of mathematically rigorous universal AI and optimal universal problem solvers. His formal theory of creativity &amp; curiosity &amp; fun explains art, science, music, and humor. He also generalized algorithmic information theory and the many-worlds theory of physics, and introduced the concept of Low-Complexity Art, the information age's extreme form of minimal art. Since 2009 he has been member of the European Academy of Sciences and Arts. He has published 333 peer-reviewed papers, earned seven best paper/best video awards, and is recipient of the 2013 Helmholtz Award of the International Neural Networks Society.* \n\n","retrieved_on":1440882627,"ups":241,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"num_comments":354,"author_flair_css_class":null,"archived":true,"id":"2xcyrl","gilded":0,"name":"t3_2xcyrl","link_flair_css_class":null,"author":"JuergenSchmidhuber","from":null,"is_self":true,"secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/2xcyrl/i_am_j\u00fcrgen_schmidhuber_ama/","from_kind":null,"created":1425051617,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","from_id":null,"stickied":false,"quarantine":false,"edited":1427278670,"score":241}

{"selftext":"About six months ago I started venturing into the realm of machine learning using small datasets that could fit on my macbook air (8GB/128GB). Now I'm starting to get into bigger data sets and I need more power. Is it wiser to spend $2,000+ to build a monster machine, or invest the time to master AWS and offload work there? Most of the data sets I expect to work with will be folders with roughly 100-1000 files each between 500MB and 10GB, occasionally larger, up to 1TB. Right now I'm working purely CPU algorithms, but would like to move towards GPU oriented tasks in the near future. \n\nEDIT: Thanks for all your help guys, I mostly took grandfthrprdx's advice below. I bought a mid-level machine with some extra RAM and ensured it was compatible with a gtx970. Anything that needs more power than that I will offload to AWS, that way I have my computer for most tasks, and I'm learning how to use AWS as I go.
