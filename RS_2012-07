I'm also incredibly interested in 18th-century Scottish fiddle music, and my chief hobby for the past six years has been playing, composing, and otherwise studying it.\n\nI've noticed that there's a lot of patterns in the tunes. The vast majority are 32 bars (measures), there's a handful of patterns that make ~5 unique bars get repeated in such a way as to fill the 32 (one common idiom is playing ABAC ABAC DEDC DEDC twice, where each letter represents a bar). And when playing a tune I've never seen or heard before, I sometimes have correct intuitions about what new content will come next--there's a lot of melodic and chordal patterns whose precise nature I can't quite articulate.\n\n## Project\nSo as any sensible person would do when faced with vague theories and good data sources, I want to package up several thousand tunes in [ABC notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_notation), cause my computer to do incantations over them, look at the patterns my program finds out of pure musicological interest, and then use them to generate new tunes.\n\n*Now it's time for the question*: do you know of any previously done work on something similar?

I'm not interested in analyzing the genre of an MP3 or contrasting the performance style of two artists. Nor am I interested in smashing together several loops of electronic sound and calling it music. This is a strictly sheet music-based project.\n\n## Practical Details\nFrom a logistics standpoint, I'd have a little bit of time this upcoming academic year to work on it (on the side), and if I wanted to I could have about twelve 20-40 hour weeks in the summer of 2013. In the summer and fall of 2013 I plan to be in Edinburgh studying ethnomusicology (yay, domain knowledge). I'm also thinking of applying to the [Singularity Institute](http://singularity.org/) and spending a week or two there in the beginning of the summer--if anyone has any thoughts on that I'd be interested in hearing them.\n\nBy asking about prior work I'm hoping someone will link me to a journal article where I'll learn what algorithms other people have used and how (un)successful that was--which would give me a place to start. If that doesn't work out:\n\n## Current Strategy\nFirst I'll create a hierarchy of things I'm interested in. One group might be broadly responsible for the overall structure of a tune, and I'll have one node recording data on length, another node recording data on which patterns of repeated bars are used, etc. Another top-level group might be broadly responsible for figuring out what type of note comes after what, with nodes that keep track of intervals (be it a minor third or a fifth or whatever), chord patterns, relative position in the bar, relative position in the tune, relationship to the key signature, etc. And so on and so forth. This obviously requires a lot of thought, and I'd like to try as much as possible to make things specific enough to be easily findable in the corpus, but abstract enough to be useful in a broader context. Then I'll run the corpus through them to get the actual data, inspect the results, probably iterate on that a few times as I realize what type of information is more valuable than others, and then feed it all to a glorified Markov chain generator for the composition aspect.\n\n-----\n\nI've done my best not to make an imposing wall of text, but...I wanted to make sure you had all the information you might want.

Sorry if it isn't the place to post this, but I'm not sure where to get help.\n\nI'm an undergraduate student from Brazil doing some research with clustering algorithms. I have an instructor, and my job was simply to implement an clustering algorithm on a teacher's framework (that she did for her PhD). The problem is that it never returns the correct results, even for it's sample dataset. After much time debugging the code, I found there is no bug... the thing is, it's not returning the correct result because the algorithm idea looks strange, and wrong for me, and it returns just one cluster (out of as many as you want).\n\nThe algorithm is a variation of the CLIQUE algorithm. It's an subspace and density-based algorithm, that uses grids and works exploiting something called \"dimension monotonicity\". Basically, it divides the dataset in grids, and then try to find the cells (of the grid) that have more objects than a certain threshold. It marks these cells as dense, and then proceed to combine them to form larger dimensions candidate clusters (candidate because they may not form a cluster if they are not dense as well), and then repeat the process. To combine the clusters, the CLIQUE algorithm uses the dimension's monotonicity lemma:\n\n**Lemma:** If a collection of points S is a cluster in a k-dimensional space, then S is also part of a cluster in any (k-1)-dimensional projections of this space.\n\n**Proof:** A k-dimensional cluster C includes the points that fall inside a union of k-dimensional dense units. Since the units are dense, the selectivity (selectivity is the fraction of total data points contained in the unit) of each one is at least r (the threshold). All the projections of any unit u in C have at least as large selectivity, because they include all points inside u, and therefore are also dense. Since the units of the cluster are connected, their projections are also connected. It follows that the projections of the points in C lie in the same cluster in any (k-1)-dimensional projection. QED.\n\nI can agree with that! The problem is that it specifies a fixed threshold (a input parameter). The algorithm that I'm working with don't use a fixed threshold, instead, it calculates a different threshold for each dimension, and then, for each candidate cluster created with the lower dimensions, it checks if it's dense for the threshold for each dimension in the cluster (i.e. it checks if the candidate cluster selectivity is higher than the threshold for each dimension that forms the cluster). The threshold formula is this (the paper doesn't prove it works, just point it works because of the lemma above, but I don't think the lemma apply because of the variable threshold):\n\n    Threshold = N*a*1.5/D\n\nBeing 'N' the number of objects in the dataset, 'a' the bin size, 'D' the dimension size and 1.5 a constant. What it's trying to do is check if the bin is 1.5 times more dense that it was going to be if the dimension was uniform. It looks like a good idea. The problem is that the monotonicity lemma doesn't apply here, and he doesn't even prove it applies. I'm going to give an example to where I think it doesn't apply, i.e. there is a dense cluster on higher dimensions that isn't found on the lower dimensions:\n\nSuppose I have a dataset with 2 clusters and 2 dimensions, both dimensions with size 10. The first cluster have 100 points uniformly distributed on 0~5 on the first dimension and 0~10 on the second. The second cluster have 8 objects, from 6~7 on the dimension 1, and from 0~4 on the second dimension. Now, both clusters have the same density (size 50 for 100 objects, size 4 for 8 objects), but the first cluster is so big that it \"hides\" the second cluster. The threshold for the first dimension and second cluster is 108\\*1\\*1.5/10. As we can see, it's a lot more than 8. Now the first cluster threshold and first dimension is 108\\*5\\*1.5/10=81, and so the first cluster would be considered dense, but it's density is the same as the second one. It look really flawed to make a formula like this, because it neglects that the cluster can be really big on the other dimensions, and so it will be really dense on some parts of the projection on lower dimensions (we don't want to find the biggest cluster, but the dense ones).\n\nI think that is the problem, because the only cluster it finds is the biggest one, but all clusters have the same density. But it was some guy PhD thesis, and it's really intelligent on the other parts, so it's really strange to have such a error (and he made tests and all these things, showing good results)... someone could help me find the flaw in my logic? Or it's really kind of wrong?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nP.S.: Yeah, I avoided saying the name of the algorithm because it's not well known (just a few papers citing), and it would be bad if one of the first results was something bad about it, but I could say it if necessary.
