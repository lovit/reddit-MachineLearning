I feel that part of the problem may be the fact that when I try to look up the derivation or explanation of the algorithm itself, most of it goes well over my head since I have not taken a calculus class yet(currently taking one). I understand the concepts of how it works in general, but I tend to have trouble remembering the specific formula/algorithm and I never really understand where it comes from.

{"selftext":"I've been using Karpethy's [char-rnn](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn) to train some models for a while now and have been trying to develop an intuition for it. I have a 500MB data set, and started with models using 10MB of it. Once I got those working well, I went to 20MB, then 50MB, then 100MB without too many issues. \n\n1. My validation loss begins close to 3.8. In most cases it will extremely quickly drop to 1.4 or 1.5, then decrease towards my current best of 1.1-1.3 depending on my hyperparameters. Sometimes if I let it go for a while the validation loss moves up and down a bit. I took the low points of these checkpoints, and made the learning rate smaller. This got me pretty good gains. I then kept doing this with smaller and smaller learning rates. My intuition is that with large learning rates you can jump over local minimums. I can only get into the local minimum with a smaller rate. Each time the validation loss goes up and down this is a new potential minimum that I can explore with a lower learning rate. Each time I jump over it, I have no idea how low it might be. Is this accurate? If so I can just let it drift up and down at the high rate, then take each of my low checkpoints and turn my rate down and start from those, then rinse and repeat for ever smaller learning rates. I've decreased my validation loss a lot doing this, but maybe I'm just overfitting? Or maybe just reducing my rate when it starts to level off is the only thing that matters, and I don't need to worry about picking these minimums?\n\n2. I tried to make the jump up to 200MB and now it isn't converging at all. I made the net sizes a lot larger, I have ~50million parameters (3 layers of 1800). My 100MB dataset was converging fine with ~20million paramaters (3 layers of 980), though I think it was underfitting by a bit. I still got my best results using the 100MB dataset and model. Do I need a smaller learning rate, or are there other tricks once the model starts getting pretty big? I'd like to use my entire dataset if I can, and my cards can handle pretty large models. I should probably just lower the size and/or learning rate and increase it until it stops converging, but was hoping changing a different parameter might be a faster/better way of going about it.\n\nThanks for any help!","author_flair_text":null,"from_id":null,"archived":false,"locked":false,"from":null,"retrieved_on":1450758900,"gilded":0,"secure_media_embed":{},"name":"t3_3n5lt0","subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","ups":12,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/3n5lt0/a_few_questions_about_training_large_rnns/","score":12,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/3n5lt0/a_few_questions_about_training_large_rnns/","over_18":false,"saved":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"stickied":false,"from_kind":null,"author":"jamesj","quarantine":false,"downs":0,"num_comments":7,"link_flair_text":null,"thumbnail":"self","is_self":true,"id":"3n5lt0","title":"A few questions about training large RNN's","post_hint":"self","hide_score":false,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","secure_media":null,"subreddit":"MachineLearning","media_embed":{},"author_flair_css_class":null,"created":1443765293,"created_utc":"1443736493","media":null,"preview":{"images":[{"source":{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/us5YD_ob_akgh82ik1eTcktrUtbUVICadBXIaLVd_eo.jpg?s=3ec6a86e5656d4b17fb79855efc161ce","height":400,"width":400},"variants":{},"id":"J3emX-4T4CS-Ir-UciUba1-q5ZBYZj2p0Lk1JJFw0lw","resolutions":[{"height":108,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/us5YD_ob_akgh82ik1eTcktrUtbUVICadBXIaLVd_eo.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=518679d07604323fc832b32befdc4526","width":108},{"width":216,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/us5YD_ob_akgh82ik1eTcktrUtbUVICadBXIaLVd_eo.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=4efa0a86984e8dd0106b754bd1682a73","height":216},{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/us5YD_ob_akgh82ik1eTcktrUtbUVICadBXIaLVd_eo.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=1e0156cfbacedc6bba9bde3c8a581c52","height":320,"width":320}]}]},"edited":1443764305}

I'll explain myself more: I'm currently looking around to apply for internships over the Summer of 2016. Last Summer I dealt with data related to health, and predicting if a user would get injured and such. It was a lot of fun, but it was a young startup and it came with a lot of great things, but also some things that weren't necessarily great: \n\ni) the nature of it being a startup meant that often the data was sparse and I had to get it myself/ I had to do a lot of ground-up work.\nii) There were a lot of deliverables: meaning there were times where efficiency of an algorithm wasn't necessarily what mattered, where a lot of it felt like Google and Stack Overflow were my answers and I wasn't using the best thing that was out there/ approaching the problem the right way.\niii) In some sense I was working with data but with the end goal of a product in mind. The objective was to sell the product, and to sell the product we needed some degree of accuracy. What I imagine/ I'm thinking about in a company is a company that is concerned with making sense of what is happening and then selling that (so kind of the reverse of the startup)\n\n**Q1: Tl;dr care to recommend data companies that deal with \"important data\"? Only caveat is that it needs to be in Europe or in America.**\n\n**Question 2** I've been considering a double major in statistics and machine learning to help me in an application to grad school but I don't know how rigorous it actually is. My school is pretty decent when it comes to ML but the courses required for the double surprised me in that they seem more focused on statistics and less about math? Anyone have opinions on whether I should just switch or do the courses that I think are relevant [stat-ml](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/new-majors-launch/program/stat-ml.html) I've been thinking about taking algebraic structures(might just skip this), [linear algebra (really really old syllabus)](http://www.math.cmu.edu/~handron/21_341/03spring/sched.html) - has a pre-req of [matrix algebra](http://www.math.cmu.edu/~handron/21_241/schedule.html) and real analysis on top of the classes that sound more technical on that list. The classes on that list that I think are technical and haven't actually taken yet are 10-701, 15-351, 10-605, 36-401 and 36-402. The others I've either already taken or I think aren't that math-inclined. My problem is that I don't have much time left here so I can't do everything or I definitely would.\n\n**Q2: Tl;dr What should I take classes that are rigorous but not a major that supposedly prepares you for grad school, or a major that supposedly prepares you for grad school (and I get the fancy cert) but I don't think prepares me well enough for grad school.**\n\nSorry if my questions seem long winded/ if what I'm posting isn't allowed here/ I've come across as a violent asshole who thinks he's really smart and is looking down on things organized by people far smarter than me. I'm just really worried about my future. It's been a long day with a lot of discussions with professors about my future ( on top of having exams) I thought of posting this to /r/datasciencejobs or /r/bigdatajobs but all the posts there I've seen have been posts about hiring and for hire people not necessarily a discussion.","author_flair_text":null,"from_id":null,"created":1443791127,"created_utc":"1443762327","media":null,"edited":false,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"MachineLearning","author_flair_css_class":null,"is_self":true,"title":"Unusual question about types of companies dealing in data that \"makes a difference\"?

If you feel this is inappropriate, please delete the question.\n\nI am looking for methods to calculate a reasonable similarity metric or clustering for my data. I have data in the form of a number of distinct events (lets call them A, B, C, D, ...), and the time between the events. A few example data points could look like,\n\n    X1 = [(A, 0), (B, 2.2), (C, 3.2), (A, 4.0)]\n    X2 = [(B, 0), (C, 2.2)]\n    X3 = [(B, 0), (C, 2.2), (D, 4.2)]\n    X4 = [(B, 0), (A, 2.2), (E, 1.5)]\n    X5 = [(B, 0), (F, 2.2), (E, 1.5), (F, 5.0), (G, 2.0), (H, 2.0)]\n    X6 = [(B, 0), (A, 0.0), (E, 1.5), (F, 5.0), (G, 2.0)]\n    X7 = [(I, 0), (J, 0.0), (K, 1.5), (L, 5.0), (M, 2.0)]\n\nTo explain the format: each entry in the array is in the format event, time since first event. E.g. for X1, at time=0, event A happened. At time=3.2 (after event A), event C happened, and so forth. Also note that multiple events may happen at the same time. \n\nIn reality, the sequences are typically much longer (50-100ish). The \"vocabulary\" of events is 1500ish. The time between two events ranges from 0.0-100.  \n\nI have a good few million data points, give or take, so I have been trying to look into a clustering based approach. From the above example, I would expect X1, X2, and X3 to have some similarity (X4 maybe, since the pattern A-&gt;B is just reversed). Also, X5 and X6 should be fairly similar. X7 should not have any similarity to any of the patterns. This is a somewhat fuzzy explanation, and that is intended. I am not looking for the one method that clusters perfectly - I am just looking for one that does an OK job taking all variables into consideration\n\nI have been looking into things like Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Self Organising Maps, unsupervised Recurrent Neural Networks, Autoencoders, just counting the similarity between triplets, ...\n\nMy major problems in finding something reasonable has been,\n\n1. The method expects an equal number of features\n2. The method sees the sequence as a bag-of-words\n3. The method does not implicitly handle a mixture of categorical and continous data\n4. The method has no notion of time\n \nI put some very broad categories on this question, simply because I am looking for suggestions or pointers to software/papers. \n\nAny help would be much appreciated, and please do comment if something is not clear. \n","from_id":null,"stickied":false,"saved":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"from_kind":null,"author":"djharsk","permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/3nbv27/similarity_clustering_methods_for_temporal_event/","ups":5,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/3nbv27/similarity_clustering_methods_for_temporal_event/","over_18":false,"score":5,"hide_score":false,"post_hint":"self","title":"Similarity / clustering methods for temporal event data","is_self":true,"id":"3nbv27","secure_media":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","num_comments":2,"downs":0,"quarantine":false,"link_flair_text":null,"thumbnail":"self","created_utc":"1443866851","created":1443895651,"edited":false,"preview":{"images":[{"resolutions":[{"width":108,"height":108,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/Na1KPWKNVl6scgS9nIHq6TItzmZ7AAjzi2AE8ocRNSc.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=656f34a961b255155ecd891f29ce769d"},{"width":216,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/Na1KPWKNVl6scgS9nIHq6TItzmZ7AAjzi2AE8ocRNSc.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=6ce510abeee6ac678d273da1d06f5def","height":216}],"id":"63C1GbYQbI4tHZMkw99e-qlyoYaGnG58yfnmnFUJ34s","variants":{},"source":{"width":316,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/Na1KPWKNVl6scgS9nIHq6TItzmZ7AAjzi2AE8ocRNSc.jpg?s=f8dd953753edb7698bb7c421ff04b05f","height":316}}]},"media":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"MachineLearning","author_flair_css_class":null}

In order to do so, they include in the training cost an \"invertibility measure\", which is the sum of the logarithms of the condition numbers of the weight matrices.\n\nI have two issues with that. First, computing the condition number has O( n^3 ) complexity, where n is the dimension of the square matrix. Second, and more importantly, in order to use this term in the training cost, you need to compute its gradient w.r.t. the weights. Technically, if I understand correctly, the condition number is differentiable almost everywhere, but all the algorithms that I've seen are quite complicated, involving matrix decompositions and iterations, and I doubt you could successfully backpropagate through them, hence you would need to estimate the gradient using something like the finite differences method, which would be very expensive.\n\nSo my questions are: is this \"invertibility measure\" really needed, given that you initialize with an orthogonal or near-orthogonal matrix and almost all square matrices are invertible? (The authors themselves claim that the invertibility measure didn't constrain the model by much in their experiments).  \nIf it is needed, how do I compute its gradient?\n\nEDIT:\n\nFound a [formula](http://www.win.tue.nl/casa/meetings/seminar/previous/_abstract051019_files/Presentation.pdf) to analitically compute the derivatives of eigenvalues from eigenvectors.\n"}

Then we feed the last hidden layer of each NN as input of all the NNs, communicating context between all the NNs.\n\nEverytime I see or read things about neuroscience, they always say how we activate other parts of the brain when we think about something and how other senses interact together. How we activate specific motor parts of our brain when we think about a task that involves moving those muscules. How we activate the fear module of our brain just by remembering a traumatic event.\n\nBut in ML, we always do single tasks, with the expectation that training a single task well will get better results than having the cooperation of many modules harder to train.\n\nI find Imagenet especially ridiculous as we try to learn everything from vision only. I would intuitively expect having a NLP module would massively increase context understanding. Same thing with sounds. We see many things about videos but they often just are conv nets where we feed several pictures at once to see motion, just by adding more channels. They are not multisense architectures. They are just a convnet trick.\n\nAlso, another related topic is general intelligence. It seems obvious that our brain works by having a few dozen modules connected to each other as a graph and that our complex decision making just comes from having modules competing against each other.\n\nBut I never saw a paper that tried to create a generalised architecture to have many modules interact together. A universal handling of context, independant of the type of network used inside the NLP RNN, the vision convnet and so on.\n\nFor example, we see many NNs to do picture description these days. They are simple convnets, where once trained we put a second NLP module to generate a sentence based on the last hidden layer of the convnet.\n\nBut there is no looping. There is no mechanism so that while writing the description, the NLP module calls a third module \"attention manager\" to zoom into a part of the image, redo the convnet forward computation and then we have a more detailed input for the NLP module, so that the description is more accurate. That would be looping, the NLP module would not simply describe the output context of the vision module, the NLP module would tell the vision module to provide more details on a part of the image.\n\nOf course, this would be dirty and full of tricks, that's why I spoke before of a having a generalised way to feed ouput layers into input layers of all the modules, so that \"contexts\" are helping each module to do a better job.\n\nWhat I said is a little messy, but my question is: Why don't we see more work on generalised architectures with lots of modules instead of massive single module, purely feedforward, single task, AIs ?","author_flair_text":null,"from_id":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"saved":false,"from_kind":null,"author":"Schlagv","ups":8,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/3nfh45/integration_of_multiple_kinds_of_nn_together/","over_18":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/3nfh45/integration_of_multiple_kinds_of_nn_together/","score":8}

After some\ntrial and error, the best model seemed to be a nn without hidden layers. The\nactivation function is: `f(x) = tanh(W . x + b)`, with `W:[300x300]` and\n`b:[300]`.\n\nThe error is defined as `sum((prediction - expected)**2)`.\n\nWhile training the error rapidly drops from around 1300 to 500, but after a\nfew hundred iterations it doesn't change anymore.\n\nTraining algorithm is minibatch SGD with L1 and L2 regularization and dropout\n(tried p=0.1,0.3,0.5).

In the former case, I have to update gradients for all weights at every step in the training process, whereas for the latter case I only update weight gradients when the weights themselves are being updated.\n\nSome papers (e.g. the DQN Atari Nature paper) claim that they use stochastic RProp because it causes the update process to remain constant as a function of the number of weights. This implies that all weight gradients are not calculated every frame since, in that case, computation would scale with the number of weights.

How many training images per class is a typical best practice? I know there are several other variables that affect the accuracy of the CNN, but what rough number is good to shoot for in each class?

To put it simply, I'd like to take a body of text, and train it to recognize certain pieces of information in that text (with as little code as possible). I've provided some generalized examples below so you can see what I'm thinking.\n\n*Example 1:*\n\n&gt; \"While the United States was fighting with Russia, it also had to deal with Spain, and that was the worst time for  the fire nation to attack, and attack it did. The United States went on to win that war, though, with the help of thousands of CocaCola bottles.\"\n\nI'd then give the algorithm the text, and tell it what data I want it to respond with (in this case, I want it to return \"United States\", since I'm trying to extract the subject of the text). I could do named entity recognition, but there's multiple named entities there, and so I'd want it to then start to look at frequency, or other factors, without possibly being told about those factors.\n\n\n*Example 2:*\n&gt; \"Hey, just checking in. If you could pick up 12 popsicles, that would be great. I'm located at 123 fake street, Cali\"\n\nIn this case, I'd want it to start to detect addresses, so I'd supply it with the answer \"123 fake street, Cali\" (and train it on thousands of examples with supplying it answers)\".\n\n\n*Example 3:*\n&gt; \"Hey man,\n\n&gt; You're right, I do love those shoes. You are always so great!\n\n&gt; Sincerely,\n\n&gt; Jordan\"\n\nIn this case, I'd want it to detect just the body of an email, rather than the signature, so I'd supply it with the answer \"You're right, I do love those shoes. You are always so great!\". \n\n**Final thoughts**\n\nThe idea would be that, in each example, I feed it thousands of training data samples (and the correct answer) and it starts to determine features about that text that it can use to generate its predictions. Then, I can give it a new sample (within it's category), and it can spit out what it predicts is the match. \n\nI feel like I've read hundreds of articles on text extraction, keyword analysis and more, however, and I can't find a simple example with code that I can work with.

If the problem is framed like this, it would be ideal -- Detect sensors that are going to be in the top 100 within the next 100 time periods, while they're still in the bottom 10,000.\n\nNOTE: Since the problem involves an overall ranking - which sensors will end up in the top 100 - the magnitude of each signal must be considered in relation to all the other magnitudes, not just the shape of the signals over time.\n\nThis could also be seen as somewhat like an early anomaly detection system, but those don't seem to frame the problem correctly for my task.\n\nThe data follows natural patterns (unlike stocks) and looks quite predictable. It's similar to detecting of trends on twitter. See [here](https://snikolov.wordpress.com/2012/11/14/early-detection-of-twitter-trends/) and [code](https://github.com/snikolov/rumor/).

{"from_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"selftext":"Hey Guys, Question about levels of abstraction.\n\nWhen it comes to writing text, Karpathy wrote an excellent [post](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) using character based training with lstms. \n\nI noticed in his post that he regularly used 2 layers of lstms and at max three. I went ahead and used 4 and 5 layers, and obtained slightly better results (in my opinion -- hard to actually judge objectively). But it started to match word pairs together. \n\nThe reason why I think this is the case is that by using more and more layers, you increase the final level of abstraction you can reach.\n\nFor example, if you used character based writing, you first have to learn that there is a concept of words separated by spaces. We'll call that level one. \n\nHowever, if you use more levels (say 5 or 6), I believe that you start to get the next level: That is, you understand that these words have relationships to each other. This is level two of abstraction.\n\nSo I guess my question is: Should I go for the 10 layer lstm? It would take me a week to train on my 980 TI. Does abstraction level correlate with the number of layers you stack? \n\nI'm hoping to reach level three of abstraction: Sentence to sentence relationships. \n\nI put 256 hidden variables on each layer with a dropout of 0.5 between each one. I'm also currently investigating word to word relationships instead of character to character. \n\nP.S. I know I have been asking many questions lately, but the help I have received has really changed my machine learning thought process tremendously.

When I chose a high coefficient for L2 norms of weights, the cost reaches infinity pretty quickly. Since I am restricting the range in which weights can vary, this seems to be due to high coefficient\n2. The same happens when I chose a low coefficient for L2 norm. This I assume is because the weights are allowed to vary more and hence the gradient gets pretty high.\n3. Since this (2) seems to be a case of gradient overshoot, I clip the gradient at a low threshold. In this case, the gradient seems to be stuck in a range where the overall cost is mostly comprised of the L2 norm (so if loss if 10, the loss due to L2 norm is 8, due to reconstruction and relu is 2). When I run this for a long time, the results seem to be OKayish, but I am not sure SGD optimized well.\n4. When I try changing the initialization of weights (even by a factor of 1000) , it just seems to delay the converging to infinity in (1) and (2) by sometime, but nothing else.\n\nFrom what I can think, the right way is to find a middle ground by setting weight-initializations, coefficient of L2 norm and Gradient Clipping. Is there a thumb rule I should follow while varying these three?\nAlso I might be missing out on some method I should have employed, if you think that is the case, please let me know.","author_flair_text":null,"from_id":null,"saved":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"stickied":false,"author":"muktabh","from_kind":null,"ups":0,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/3o8mlr/please_advice_exploding_gradient/","score":0,"over_18":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/3o8mlr/please_advice_exploding_gradient/"}

My initial set of data is unfortunately quite small, so I've generated artificial trials by time-frequency bootstrapping (break down each trial by time and frequency components and randomly recombine within a particular class to generate novel trials). \n\nInstead of using cross validation, I'm training on only the artificial dataset and testing on the actual data. Does this seem like a legitimate technique or am I missing something that will confound my results? I've tested and it seems that once past a minimum number of artificial trials, generating more doesn't seem to increase classification accuracy. \n\nI was hoping to compare classification of the actual data to a label shuffled null set, but without cross validation I only have a single accuracy value. Would it make sense to subsample from the test data and do a number of training/test loops to generate a distribution of classification accuracies?\n\nI apologize if these are obvious questions, but I'm quite new to ML and learning on my own!

{"selftext":"Hi there!\n\nI have data in the format of text and associated labels given by values between 1 and 5, where 2.5 is the zero point (&gt; 2.5 means the label is positive for this instance, &lt; 2.5 means it is negative, 2.5 is neutral).

Each array should be a sentence. \n\nFor example the input sentence would be: \"The stars shine very brightly.\" and the output sentence would be something like \"They shine brightly because of the enormous amount of energy they contain\". \n\nMy full script can be found on github:\nhttps://github.com/LeavesBreathe/Sequence-To-Sequence-Generation-Skip-Thoughts-/blob/master/sentence_to_sentence_generation.py\n\nThere are plenty of examples in Keras using text-generation, but they all use one-hot vectors for words/letters. \n\nHowever, I've heard from several that using an embedding layer is more efficient than one-hotting words. To that end, I can't find my examples that use embedding AND predict from their model. \n\nThe main problem I'm currently having is this. The whole thing works except that when I do the predict function, I end up getting a 1d array of incredibly small numbers. Instead, I want to get a 1d array of integers that correspond with the index_to_word dictionary. \n\nHere is an example of my output currently when I use the model.predict function:\n    \n\t[ 0.00055403  0.00111817  0.00215877  0.00108721  0.000766    0.00319258\n\t  0.00298639  0.00099919  0.00404425  0.00052357  0.00211825  0.00094894\n\t  0.00157265  0.00308218  0.01090179  0.00284554  0.00237611  0.00128609\n\t  0.01087372  0.01681928  0.00361982  0.02696433  0.043065    0.00565515\n\t  0.0075417   0.01731373  0.02892326  0.00648065  0.0115167   0.00250217\n\t  0.04943457  0.0069293   0.03155829  0.00629489  0.00888385  0.00769502\n\t  0.00804267  0.01472379  0.01857707  0.03626939  0.11137675  0.06347591\n\t  0.03270336  0.05129562  0.08768249  0.08185349  0.06703533  0.07524383\n\t  0.01045811  0.00662899]\n\n\nI guess my question is: How do you use a model.predict function knowing that you're using an embedding layer?

{"from_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"selftext":"Hi guys! I want to start off by saying that ML is not my area, but recently I have started reading a lot about it and it really intrigues me.\n\nOne thing that has crossed my mind is how you stop \"self-enforcing\" (not sure if that is the correct term) predictions/recommendations in engines based on a bunch of data.\n\nTo clarify, I discovered Quake III Arena while trying to download Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 from DC++. I discovered french electro duo Justice while searching for Metallica on Spotify. A lot of the things I've discovered have been relatively random, and I can't help but think that if a recommendation engine were to \"choose for me\" instead, I would've nevered discovered the greatest FPS of all time while searching for a skateboard game, or finding an electro duo while searching for heavy metal. In contrast, today I noticed that the \"Recommended for you\" playlist on Spotify is entirely based on what genres I've listened to in the last weeks, resulting in a playlist consisting solely of Swedish hiphop. If I were to listen to that, next week's recommended playlist would probably also just consist of that genre.\n\nI guess my question is: with 1. all the data collected on me 2. the trend that more and more decisions are taken for me by intelligent engines; wouldn't I ultimately be seeing the same things over and over again? Is this some kind of phenomenon that is discussed in ML? I guess there is an obvious answer to this, but I can't really find it by searching, and was wondering if you guys could help me in my thinking.","subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","name":"t3_3ogfzu","secure_media_embed":{},"gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1450736626,"from":null,"locked":false,"archived":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/3ogfzu/how_do_you_avoid_selfenforcing/","over_18":false,"score":4,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/3ogfzu/how_do_you_avoid_selfenforcing/","ups":4,"from_kind":null,"author":"thefone","stickied":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"saved":false,"thumbnail":"self","link_flair_text":null,"num_comments":7,"downs":0,"quarantine":false,"secure_media":null,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","distinguished":null,"hide_score":false,"title":"How do you avoid self-enforcing predictions/recommendations?","is_self":true,"id":"3ogfzu","author_flair_css_class":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"MachineLearning","edited":1444661225,"media":null,"created_utc":"1444661030","created":1444689830}

However, what excites me about ML isn't really the prevalent uses of ML but rather just the math and theories behind it. I want my work to \"matter\" in a way that I find meaningful (I briefly debated studying to be a doctor before deciding something more math-intensive is the right choice for me). So for me, the ideal would be applying ML methods (or even just computational methods) in fields that can benefit other people. The example I come up with is using quantitative methods to identify pathologies based on certain markers: this is actually something someone at my university's pharm school is working jointly with my (undergrad) lab to accomplish. But while quantitative/ computational biology is one such useful application of ML methods, I imagine the field have much more.\n\nReally, I'm just interested in anything involving doing ML for the benefit of society:\n\n* potential fields\n\n* potential career paths (I have no problem doing a PhD, but are they required)\n\n* potential companies or types of companies\n\n* interesting papers\n\n* interesting research groups\n\n* relevant anecdotes\n\n* anything else you find relevant\n\nAnd so on.

I've heard the definitions about probability of classifying a positive example as positive over a randomly sample negative example and all that. That's fine.\n\nMy interest here is in things that make it work extremely poorly and I think I've found a case but would just like some confirmation that I'm thinking about it correctly. Basically imagine that you have some data in two classes and you train two separate classifiers for it. The classifiers identify two parallel hyperplanes to separate the classes but they are not equivalent. Now when you adjust the threshold to generate the ROC curve those hyperplanes will basically be translated up and down normal to their direction and at each point sensitivity/specificity are calculated and so on. But if they're parallel they will surely cover the same ground and so the AUC will be identical even if one classifier is intuitively much worse than the other.\n\nAny help would be much appreciated.

I have not been able to find a clear treatment for these data in the literature. The standard solution seems to be treating missing entries as 0's, but for my specific case, a value of 0 means that we know something about that variable and it takes a value of 0, while not knowing the value of the variable represents a different situation. \nMy question is, do you guys know of any way to deal with these situations? I have been thinking about trying to encode the missing values with a -1, but I'm also not sure if that's a good solution, since for real valued variables, -1 is closer to 0 than to 10.","from_id":null,"created_utc":"1444837248","created":1444866048,"edited":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"MachineLearning","author_flair_css_class":null,"hide_score":false,"id":"3oqgxe","is_self":true,"title":"Question about machine learning with sparse data","secure_media":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","num_comments":1,"downs":0,"quarantine":false,"link_flair_text":null,"thumbnail":"self"}

The length of the chunk for the learning is 100 samples, multiplied for 1000 epochs.\n\n[here is the original post I made on *stats.stackexchange.com* (containing the full source code of the autoencoder)](http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/176881/cannot-make-this-autoencoder-network-function-properly-with-convolutional-and-m)\n\nThank you for any hint on what might be wrong! \n\nUPDATE: The following is an illustration of the problem: the upper row are some samples set as inputs of the network, the lower row is the reconstruction: http://i.imgur.com/8IXAhr4.png\n\nUPDATE: **SOLVED!!**\nHere is my implementation: http://nopaste.linux-dev.org/?782799\nand here is a visualization of the result with only 2 bottleneck nodes!: http://imgur.com/xJQhZ6f Is there still room for improvement?","author_flair_text":null,"name":"t3_3ou5no","secure_media_embed":{},"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","archived":false,"from":null,"locked":false,"retrieved_on":1450730157,"gilded":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"MachineLearning","media_embed":{},"preview":{"images":[{"resolutions":[{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/OQYM_45CKFG1JoIEuEKdTyN8BgV_NLxx4EGJMov8NEc.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=e0b3d23cc9536aafa22c4dfe1f2381fc","height":21,"width":108},{"width":216,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/OQYM_45CKFG1JoIEuEKdTyN8BgV_NLxx4EGJMov8NEc.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=7198dae9f31b06d2c87c37cc56e3a6c4","height":42},{"width":320,"height":62,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/OQYM_45CKFG1JoIEuEKdTyN8BgV_NLxx4EGJMov8NEc.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=a11ae441fff5c277be4f74f1dc73a595"},{"height":125,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/OQYM_45CKFG1JoIEuEKdTyN8BgV_NLxx4EGJMov8NEc.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;s=0c873fb39c03a60bf0b70117e2d0ad66","width":640},{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/OQYM_45CKFG1JoIEuEKdTyN8BgV_NLxx4EGJMov8NEc.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=960&amp;s=4d0d276bc74c8837a25db84568e59bbc","height":188,"width":960},{"width":1080,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/OQYM_45CKFG1JoIEuEKdTyN8BgV_NLxx4EGJMov8NEc.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=1080&amp;s=6770da91cdbb92d637b9b3cbbb90adba","height":211}],"variants":{},"id":"sxzmq9qtiVzPKjk6qMPzYKRRxFk_AmGy_CjTng8Ui4A","source":{"height":232,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/OQYM_45CKFG1JoIEuEKdTyN8BgV_NLxx4EGJMov8NEc.jpg?s=49d8a4533d7ee89e5d6013fcb6a143e2","width":1183}}]},"media":null,"edited":1444935876,"created":1444930262,"created_utc":"1444901462","thumbnail":"self","link_flair_text":null,"quarantine":false,"downs":0,"num_comments":14,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","secure_media":null,"is_self":true,"title":"help making a convolutional autoencoder","id":"3ou5no","post_hint":"self","hide_score":false}

But I want to show that it is also possible to cluster and visualize data with unsupervised training. I used the autoencoder on the [theano website](http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/dA.html), reduced dimensionality and visualized the data using PCA.\nWithout any training, the raw data looks like [this](http://imgur.com/dNWy4Mx). After pretraining the first layer, the data looks like [this](http://imgur.com/mROAATo). As you can see, the data is hardly clustered. When I train the network with labels and then output the values of the second last layers and visualize that, it looks like [this](http://imgur.com/9a3CMi5). Here you see that the data has been split way better.

Based upon these vectorizations, I apply a K-means to cluster the words, and I've been absolutely blown away by the results. It groups them very well: better than I ever could...and all in 10 minutes. \n\nHere's an example of one cluster of words from 33mb doc on astronomy:\n\n\t[265:'stars','fusion','fission','H','speed_of_light','Hydrogen','atoms','hydrogen','energy']\n\nIf anyone else is interested in doing this, there's a nice guide here: http://www.yseam.com/blog/WV.html\n\nHowever, there is a huge problem I have with this approach. Word2Vec only works well on words that appear at least ~5 times within your corpus. From Zipf's law, we know that there are going to be *many* words that don't even come close to reaching this number. \n\nI feel that those who are involved with translation would also have this problem: What do you do with all of these infrequent words? What happens when you're training your neural net and you come across one of these words?\n\nIdeas I've come across:\n\n1. Make another cluster, and just throw all of these infrequent words into that cluster. (Plausible, but you still lose all meaning of the word)\n\n2. Simply delete the words, and have the neural net never know that there was that word (I really don't like this idea, because it throws off the grammar/sentiment properties of your net)\n\n3. Just Vectorize the words with a word count of 1 (leads to all your clusters being contaminated by words that simply don't belong.)\n\n4. Increase Your Training Corpus Size by Orders of Magnitude, and delete infrequent words (I can probably get about 1gb of text at the most, but with more text will come more infrequent words!!!)\n\nThese just don't seem like the best approaches. Is there a better idea to group these infrequent words? Ram and Gpu Memory is not a concern at all.

Well, my idea is that there are too many variables to handle each one of them with simple if/elses.. maybe there is a good opportunity with a rent 10-20% more expensive, that would be filtered out if I did a simple `if &lt; x`..

So the area is Machine Learning &amp; Data Mining, and essentially this company has a sales forecasting application that uses Bayesian classifiers to help predict whether a sale will win or lose.\n\nMy job (or at least part of it) is to try and establish which attributes in the model are the most influencing factors to a sale. So for example, if the model predicts that this on going sale is at the risk of a loss, I have to find which factors are providing the most influence on the prediction.\n\nI'm in the research stage at the moment, just looking at past research and an overall view of sales forecasting and bayesian classifiers, but I'm fairly stumped when it comes down to how I'll try and identify the most influential ones.\n\nIf anyone can offer any advice, good papers/journals to look up, I'd really appreciate it.

We think of all possible ways it could be set up (I guess this would create a 2 variable system, one being input, and the other being the only parameter)\n\nThen we consider:\n\n- 1 input, 2 parameters\n- 1 input, n parameters\n- 2 inputs, 1 parameter\n- 2 inputs, 2 parameters\n\nand so on. Obviously there are two many cases but we can make some observations:\n\n- We don't need parameters that are fed partial inputs, e.g., for a 2 input network, all our parameters have 2 inputs. We don't need any parameter with 1 input because it's the equivalent of a 2-input parameter one of which is zero.\n- We can limit n, e.g., for 1 grayscale pixel, input is 0-255. Maybe we can use this to conclude a value of n beyond which further enumeration is superfluous.\n\n\nAnyway I hope you get the idea. So my question is, is there any resource, tutorial, article, book chapter that discusses neural networks along these lines?\n\nsecond question: is there something like a directory/collection of well-known neural network designs? (**EDIT 1**: in other words, well-known NN architectures).

My idea is a bit different from Kim Yoon's CNN (http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5882). The main difference is that the model tries to detect the sense of each word before learning sentiment classification.\n\nThe overall architecture is illustrated at http://imgur.com/ap113cl. The first layer is the project layer with word2vec embedding from one-hot-encoding vectors. The second layer is the higher-level features from the first layer.

However, when we look at the implementation of an ANN, then we see that there is no term which defines how many data points we need to train on. In fact, one of the major parameters to tune are the regularization terms and the number of epochs (or iterations). Also, it has been shown that ANN are universal approximators, and they can learn functions like XOR using small data but enough epochs. \n\nSo, building on that shouldn't it be possible for an ANN to learn using a small data set, of the order which is used by SVMs, Logistic Regressions (which can all be represented as ANN), e.g. 20k instances for binary sentiment analysis. \n\nWhat are some limitations of using ANN for small data, e.g. Iris data with ~100 instances, movie reviews data ~20k instances etc?\n\nDoesn't small data (Order of 1000) with 1000 times more epochs equals big data (Order of 10^6), when it comes to training neural networks?

Just want to note that I don't have any formal education in machine learning, just trying to learn it on the side, so forgive me if the questions sound a little noobish. \n\nAfter several epochs of testing, I find that my loss dips below 0 and eventually reaches -2. At the same time, the accuracy is consistent and never changes from the original value. This happened after I changed the rnn's final output to be a single variable. In a setup I tested before this, I had the rnn's final output to have 4 variables. With this setup, the loss eventually reached to a low number, 0.05, but the accuracy was around 0.65. The plot of the accuracy over several epochs was changing unlike the single variable case, but it was always decreasing. So I'm having trouble understanding how to interpret these results. Does a loss of 0.05 and an accuracy of 0.65 mean 'the rnn will use 95% of the input data to correctly predict 65% of the time'? If that is the case, what does it mean to have a negative loss? And I believe the usual behavior of an rnn is to increase in accuracy while the loss is taken out. How come the accuracy never increases in either setup I've tried? I'm sure I'm doing something wrong, I appreciate any tips on where that may be.","subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","name":"t3_3pq7is","secure_media_embed":{},"from":null,"locked":false,"retrieved_on":1450714850,"gilded":0,"archived":false}

You can easily get 500+ features if you like.\n\n1. Feature Selection Leakage\n\nI for sure made that mistake. As a simple method of feature selection I used GBM to determine the importance of each feature and cut of all features below a certain threshold. So this is bad correct? I now removed that step and simply to low variance and correlation filtering. Problem is this leaves me with 100+ features. I thought it was bad to have many features compared to rows. Plus this of course greatly increases runtime.\n\nOther options of feature selection? PCA seems to greatly reduce performance.\n\n2. Parameter Selection\n\nspecially in aspect of runtime as the article mentions inner and outer cross validation loops. So that would lead to runtimes of days for what I seem simple models (n = 1000).\n\nSo for optimizing parameters I should only use a part of all data available? And then repeat the whole optimization step in a outer CV loop? Isn't that a bit excessive?\n\nIn my case I might get 10 new data points (measurements) a year. Am I correct to assume I can optimize parameters once and not bother to do it again when creating a new model with new data points say once a year?","from_id":null,"locked":false,"from":null,"retrieved_on":1450714620,"gilded":0,"archived":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","secure_media_embed":{},"name":"t3_3pqp8a","permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/3pqp8a/automatic_model_generation_workflow_optimal_vs/","ups":0,"score":0,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/3pqp8a/automatic_model_generation_workflow_optimal_vs/","over_18":false,"saved":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"stickied":false,"from_kind":null,"author":"beginner_"}

I currently input a sentence of words (represented by a cluster id and then a word id) and ask the LSTM to predict the next word, and it works pretty well. If you are interested in the clustering, the ideas was started in this thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/3og80o/recreating_skipthoughts_paper_in_keras/\n\nIf you're interested on how to handle infrequent words in clustering: https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/3p7tns/handling_infrequent_words_in_corpus_with_word2vec/\n\n\tCurrently:\n\n\tInput Sentence of Words --&gt; Predicts next word\n\n\tGoal:\n\n\tInput Sentence of Words --&gt; Predict next sentence\n\n\nI'm looking now into feeding the LSTM and entire sentence, and then asking it to produce an entire sentence. However, the major problem is this: I don't know how to format y_train (or the labels)\n\nFor x_train (input), I understand that I use a 2d array, and pad the array with 0's. So that the first dimension is the number of samples, and the second dimension is the sentence that I'm feeding into the lstm. I then feed this into Keras's embedding layer -- and it works great! (I mask the zeros)\n\nHowever, the 2d y_train is where I get lost. Currently, I one-hot my y_train to the *one word* that is supposed to come next. In order to have y_train be a sequence of words, it almost seems I would have to add an extra dimension (which is impossible right?). I have a Dense Layer at the end which condenses the output to 2d, followed by a softmax.  \n\nSo the question is: How do you format the y_train so that you can output an entire sentence versus a word? \n\nHopefully others in the future with this question can use this post!

All through undergrad and to this day, I've been reading papers about this specific topic.\n\nI've run across papers in CS, Operations Research, Statistics and Economics specific journals. As well as thesis projects that you can just find online. A lot of the papers do things like show that \"X\" technique can be used to predict winners ([Adapting support vector machine methods for horserace odds prediction](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10479-006-0131-7)), others compare the performance of variations of learning algorithms in the same family([A Case Study Using Neural Network Algorithms: Horse Racing Predictions in Jamaica](https://eprints.usq.edu.au/4300/1/Williams_Li_Publ_version.pdf)), some use horse racing as an example of how prediction markets work ([Prediction Markets for Economic Forecasting](http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2012/6/13%20prediction%20markets%20wolfers/13%20prediction%20markets%20wolfers.pdf)) and so on.\n\nI've noticed that in a lot of the papers that really take a focus on testing some classification algorithm, especially the CS papers, never really go into how they do feature selection. They generally say that it is important and that there are a lot of variables involved and we decided to pick these 5,7,12, or whatever the number is. Sometimes they'll say that they spoke to an \"expert\" or they will just use the same features that were used in another paper but with a different learning technique ([here](http://www.researchgate.net/publication/4030214_Neural_networks_mine_for_gold_at_the_greyhound_racetrack)).\n\nWhat I want to know is, what effect does using various feature selection algorithms have on your prediction accuracy and ROI? So I'd start with as many explanatory variables as possible and then use different feature selection algorithms while keeping the classification algorithm the same and then check the results.","subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","secure_media_embed":{},"name":"t3_3psylf","from":null,"retrieved_on":1450713495,"locked":false,"gilded":0,"archived":false}

When using denoising autoencoders, the input values are just set randomly to 0, when non-training the input is being put into the network without corruption. Why are the values not adjusted then like when using dropout?\n- When I am training a second layer, are the inputs also set randomly to 0 or is this only done for the lowest input layer?\n- An upper layer is trained with the hidden data of the lower layer. The lower layer is trained with tied weights, so the results are not as good as with untied weights. When the network is being unfolded and trained as a whole with untied weights, does the pretraining of the upper layers still make sense, since they have to learn from input which later don't appear anymore? Wouldn't it make more sense to pretrain one layer, then untie it and then train the next layer?\n- When using dropout, in the unfolded phase, does it make sense to use dropout in the decoding part of the network?\n- When corrupting the input, is there any heuristic which input to corrupt? Like corrupt input values that are 1 seldomly with a higher probability?\n- From the experience I got so far, I noticed when visualizing data using PCA/tsne, the network does not need to have several layers, one layer is enough. Is one layer really enough to learn patterns from data and cluster/visualize data accordingly?\n","author_flair_text":null,"from_id":null,"archived":false,"retrieved_on":1450711164,"from":null,"locked":false,"gilded":0,"secure_media_embed":{},"name":"t3_3pxyef","subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","ups":1,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/3pxyef/questions_about_stacked_denoising_autoencoders/","score":1,"over_18":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/3pxyef/questions_about_stacked_denoising_autoencoders/","saved":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"stickied":false,"author":"pumpkin105","from_kind":null}

These are great for working with bit vars.\n\nThe main limit of neuralnets is they are more of a computing format and lack external memory to save and load large amounts of data. Convolutional Neuralnets deal with that by running the same neuralnet centered on each pixel, so they can gradually talk to eachother across distance. Deepmind's kind of Neural Turing Machine uses a turing tape of small blocks of bits. Eurisko stored data in lisp lists, numbers, and derived its own datastructs.\n\nEurisko's datastructs, starting with lisp's basic datstructs, were most flexible because they were sparse. The others are more linear, even with multi-tape-turing. But with that flexibility came the usual problems of Turing Completeness including infinite loops.\n\nSomewhere between, keeping the sparseness, but not the full power of lisp easily able to destroy itself, I expect to find a good combination of neuralnet and compute theory, something that merges statistical learning with data storage and sparse navigating through it. Example: immutable binary forest nodes, which lack lisp's ability to have cycles while still being sparse and potentially very high dimensional.","from_id":null}

Six to Ten LSTM Layers\n2. Anywhere from 512 to 1024 Hidden Variables.\n\nTo clarify, chars *are not characters*, they are words. I take all the words in the text and cluster them. From that I assign a cluster id and a word id. This allows chars to be around 400. I used to do chars which is why the variable is named that way. \n\nFor reference, my Keras model is below:\n\tnumber_of_layers = 6\n\thidden_variables = 512\n\tchars = 400\n\n\tprint('Build model...')\n\tmodel = Sequential()\n\tmodel.add(Embedding(input_dim=(len(chars)), output_dim=512, input_length=maxlen))\n\tmodel.add(LSTM(hidden_variables, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(maxlen, len(chars))))\n\tmodel.add(Dropout(dropout))\n\tfor z in range(0,number_of_layers-2):\n\t    model.add(LSTM(hidden_variables, return_sequences=True))\n\t    model.add(Dropout(dropout))\n\tmodel.add(LSTM(hidden_variables, return_sequences=False))\n\tmodel.add(Dropout(dropout))\n\tmodel.add(Dense(len(chars))) #this is the length of your output array. \n\tmodel.add(Activation('softmax'))\n\tprint('you are about to compile')\n\tmodel.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam')\n\tprint('you finished compiling')\n\n\nI am inputting sentences and predicting the next word. I have much training data (about 10M samples), and I end up doing a softmax over ~400 outputs. However, these large neural nets on a 980 Ti take about 9 days to train for 100 epochs. I'm trying to figure out ways to speed up testing so that I can estimate what parameters are best, and then do a full 9 training days.\n\nMy goal is to have each test to take at most 48 hours. Once the most promising configuration is observed, we'll run the full LSTM 9 day training. \n\nHere are a few ideas to speed things up:\n\nIdea 1: Change all the LSTMS to GRU's -- GRU's are about 2x faster, but LSTM's seem to outperform them in the long run (as the number of epochs increase).\n\nIdea 2: Change the learning rate on the Adam Optimizer from the standard 0.001 to 0.010. After about epoch 10, decrease the learning rate by half each time. Stop learning after epoch 20.\n\nIdea 3: Decrease hidden variable numbers or LSTM layer numbers -- I dislike this option the most because I feel that the level of abstraction reached will be significantly lower. \n\nAre there any other ideas you guys can think of? Maybe I'm missing something obvious. I'm also considering buying another 980 TI to run two separate configurations at once. \n\nAs it currently stands with the config above, it takes me about 9 days to get 100 epochs. \n\nThanks!","from_kind":null,"author":"LeavesBreathe","saved":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"stickied":false,"score":7,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/3q2w7g/accelerating_deep_lstm_nets_training_time/","over_18":false,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/3q2w7g/accelerating_deep_lstm_nets_training_time/","ups":7}

I can say that I found the theory very interesting - the maths is compelling and I loved how the concepts brought all the statistics and linear algebra that I had learnt before in one place.\n\n\nHOWEVER, what I'm worried about is whether a job will be actually very intellectually stimulating at all. Looking at the student projects for the Stanford course, it seems like pretty much all of them involve trying to make a number go down (error rate) by changing other numbers (hyperparameters, variables) without really using much linear algebra or statistics to get those numbers. It just seems like they just try everything, and THEN in retrospect try to explain why this particular set of numbers worked best by saying, ah, yes, this makes sense because X. Like, if the opposite approach worked, they'd just say ah yes because Y. It was exactly like how some of my courseworks ended up being, and it just feels so meaningless! At the end of the day you don't really learn much from the work itself because everything is just probablys and maybes.\n\n\nIs this kind of thing just fundamental in machine learning jobs? Do you ever really need to have understood deeply the mechanics that underpin the practice? I KNOW that, in order to choose an approach, you could theorise that SVNs would work better in this particular domain or something. But even in Kaggle competitions, looking at the postmortems by the winners, it turns out that it was just a lot of trial and error, and choosing a combination of different approaches, which might as well have been black boxes. And all the work is really just coding it all up, making it run fast, maybe writing a batch script to be able to use all the data, etc. There was something Andrew Ng said as well, about how the frontier now is not in theory, but simply in computing power, which further gives me the impression that in practice it's mainly just dark arts and trial and error.\n\n\nI'm at the point now where I've graduated with my Masters in Engineering, and I must choose between going into industry as an engineer/machine learning engineer.. or to throw it all away and go into Medicine.\n\n\nMy biggest fear in life is having a job that feels meaningless. Data science in order to predict how often you should send push notifications feels utterly meaningless to me, and I'm not sure I could derive much pleasure from it unless it was particularly intellectually stimulating. Even if it did get results, and get you a number (\"3 times a week!\"), it just.. compared to diagnosing someone and helping them personally with an illness.. ugh.\n\n\nI've also shadowed doctors enough over the past months to know that as a doctor I will be guaranteed to have a fundamentally meaningful job for the rest of my life, even with the paperwork and bureaucracy, because I would be directly helping individuals with their problems. It will just take another 4 years of medical school. (Money thankfully is not a problem and is the least of my worries. It's just wanting to impact the world in any way I can)\n\nBut I would like to think it's possible to get a meaningful job in Engineering too, and I have a natural affinity to the theories and the maths. People like Erik Bern inspire me to no end. Seeing how great Spotify's Discover Weekly is, how well it works for me personally, is a great motivation for ML. And there's still all this talk about how the world needs Data Scientists etc etc.\n\nFrom talking to software engineers in industry, it seems like it's very possible to end up being a small cog helping a company with growth by doing tedious jobs. I would never ever want to do this, and would much prefer ML jobs where ML is actually part of the product itself (either recommendations engines, or robotics, or NLP etc), rather than just to help a company grow. Do many of these kinds of jobs exist, because I can't really find many, and if anyone is in this kind of job, can you tell me how it's like?\n\nSo yeah, it's a big decision to make, whether to stick with this and hope to be able to impact the world in a bigger way (but maybe end up not doing so at all), or to go into medicine and have a smaller but guaranteed impact. If anyone can tell me if my outlook on the tedium in Machine Learning jobs is accurate, and maybe tell me what the most rewarding part of the work is, it'd be appreciated!","from_id":null,"gilded":0,"locked":false,"retrieved_on":1450708054,"from":null,"archived":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","secure_media_embed":{},"name":"t3_3q4gwi","media_embed":{},"subreddit":"MachineLearning","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":"1445754656","created":1445783456,"edited":false,"media":null,"num_comments":60,"downs":0,"quarantine":false,"thumbnail":"self","link_flair_text":null,"hide_score":false,"id":"3q4gwi","title":"How interesting is ML actually in practice, compared to learning it?

So the first 4 frames (4 x 128) are convolved with 256 filters that are also 4 x 128 in shape, giving rise to 1 x 256 outputs. Because this is a convolution, we get this over the entire time axis, so the input is 599 x 128 and the output is 596 x 256. This is then max-pooled to 149 x 256 (pool size 4).\n\nMy knowledge of neural networks is limited to using libraries and I don't understand much of the theory behind it, so I don't understand how this is a 1D convolution but uses a 2D shape (4x128). An example of this first layer in any python library/torch would probably clear up my confusion.","from_id":null}

I am wondering if such methods are worth it, and give significant boosts over, say, plain old SGD?\n\nThe reason I ask is because gradients are noisy. Also, with more complex optimization algorithms more time is required for a single update; in that same time, multiple SGD updates can be done (so complex optimization algorithms have to deal with this trade off).\n\nFurther, correct me if I am wrong, the error surface changes from minibatch to minibatch (since the optimal weights will typically be different for any given minibatch).\n\nSo given noisy gradients, changing error surfaces, and the fact that SGD can go through multiple updates in the same time as a single update for a more complex optimization algorithm, are more complex optimization algorithms worth it?\n\nDoes the answer to the above depend on the network type? E.g. for RNNs and LSTMs perhaps hessian-free results in way better results?\n\nAre there any empirical studies of different optimization methods on different network types?\n\nOptimization seems quite critical to deep learning, and I am curious about the above.\n\nThanks in advance for sharing your knowledge!","from_id":null,"created_utc":"1446143142","created":1446171942,"edited":false,"media":null,"subreddit":"MachineLearning","media_embed":{},"author_flair_css_class":null,"hide_score":false,"id":"3qqhx2","title":"Deep networks, LSTMs, and other complex architectures: is SGD enough?","is_self":true,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","distinguished":null,"secure_media":null,"downs":0,"num_comments":6,"quarantine":false,"link_flair_text":null,"thumbnail":"self"}

I'm trying to filter out the indexes, glossaries, sources, and whatnot. I just want the text itself for machine learning.\n\nI've written some python regex, but I figured I should post here and ask: Is there a good resource to do this? I have about a 1gb worth of pdfs. What really kills me is there are random '*()$*#' parts in the text. Ideally, there would be a really comprehensive regex script that would filter out the majority of this information. \n\nHere is what I have written so far.

There isn't a \"simple\" functional form which governs the shape of the simulation.

Then the output layer just needs to be n dimensional (where n is the vector size).\n\nThen the LSTM decoder output is a set of n-dimensional vectors: [ outputVec1, outputVec2, ... ] which is essentially a matrix, let's call this matrix **Y**. We then compare **Y** with the target output matrix, let's call it **T**. The height of **Y** and **T** may differ, so we can use zero padding. Afterwards, our loss can be, loss = sum( (**Y**-**T**)^2 ), or elementwise difference, followed by elementwise squaring, followed by a sum on all elements.\n\n(You can use kNN on Y to get the actual French sentence).\n\nTo me the above would be a **lot** more efficient.
