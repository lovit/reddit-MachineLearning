Also I'm not in love with science or anything, I just like to think long on problems(walking in circles at midnights) and I would be dissatisfied if I should do this with problems I don't think worth it. Yeah it sounds lame and mediocre, and I'm aware that I'm not a top shot, but anyway I do this stuff. \n\nI've made my cv for an internship position, so I would humbly ask you guys, what do you think about my prospects/what should I do?

Also odds in other parts of the world?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Am I too old, so I should get a life instead? :) I don&amp;#39;t have problems with the industry, I just try to avoid ending up with a boring &amp;quot;business logic&amp;quot; job. Also I&amp;#39;m not in love with science or anything, I just like to think long on problems(walking in circles at midnights) and I would be dissatisfied if I should do this with problems I don&amp;#39;t think worth it. Yeah it sounds lame and mediocre, and I&amp;#39;m aware that I&amp;#39;m not a top shot, but anyway I do this stuff. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve made my cv for an internship position, so I would humbly ask you guys, what do you think about my prospects/what should I do?

We have a fixed undirected graph with edges pretty much randomly distributed, with the exception that each node has at least two edges.\n\nThen a monster, a princess, and an exit are each assigned a random location on the graph. The princess and monster are both informed of the starting location of each other. The princess wins if she can reach the exit. The monster wins if he reaches the princess. Each turn, both characters may move to an adjacent node, with the sole exception that the monster may not move onto the exit. Lastly, if a path consisting of at most 3 edges can be made from the princess to the monster, the two are said to hear each other, and both are informed of this event.\n\nMy intuition says both should race to the exit. If the princess starts in a good location she can simply beat the monster to it. However, if the monster gets there first, then he should simply patrol around and try to listen for the princess. If he can hear her, he should be able to do a bit of triangulation by realizing that the first time he hears her she is exactly within three nodes of him. (Given this, if the princess cannot beat the monster, she should wait a while before trying to reach the exit.) If he hears her again, he can simply try to move inbetween the exit and the princess as best he can while simultaneously trying to capture the princess.\n\nSo basically, my goal is to write the optimal bots for both the princess and monster.

Each turn, both characters may move to an adjacent node, with the sole exception that the monster may not move onto the exit. Lastly, if a path consisting of at most 3 edges can be made from the princess to the monster, the two are said to hear each other, and both are informed of this event.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My intuition says both should race to the exit. If the princess starts in a good location she can simply beat the monster to it. However, if the monster gets there first, then he should simply patrol around and try to listen for the princess. If he can hear her, he should be able to do a bit of triangulation by realizing that the first time he hears her she is exactly within three nodes of him. (Given this, if the princess cannot beat the monster, she should wait a while before trying to reach the exit.) If he hears her again, he can simply try to move inbetween the exit and the princess as best he can while simultaneously trying to capture the princess.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So basically, my goal is to write the optimal bots for both the princess and monster. Links and insight are very much appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","created":1303102285,"hidden":false,"over_18":false}
