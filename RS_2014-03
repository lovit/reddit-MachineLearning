I want to get a masters in machine learning and need a sanity check on my career goals (especially since I am considering Georgia Tech's online CS masters program). I am also very interested in computer vision. Below are two sections: background about me and a list of questions I have. Feel free to skim/skip the first section. \n\n&amp;&amp;\n\n&amp;&amp;\n\nI have a certain wanderlust in me, and nothing to keep me from traveling (but money). My current plan is to teach English for a couple of years in South Korea after graduation, while enrolling in Georgia Tech's online computer science masters (machine learning specialty). That teaching position offers a strong compensation package and lots of free time. I would be able to put about 30,000 USD into savings in 2 years, even after the cost of the masters program. \n\nMy resume is interesting and getting stronger. I have 5 years experience teaching robotics and programming to middle &amp; high school students. I worked as a (supernumerary) software engineer for a few months. I was president of the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Club at my university and lead of a competition robotics team (for which I used OpenCV). I will be studying abroad in the fall (Norway). I am almost certain to get into a great robotics/computer vision undergraduate research position (REU) at a big-name school this summer (for once nepotism works in my favor!). I have done a number of self-directed programming projects including: computational fluid dynamics, simulation of plasma shocks in the interstellar medium/solar wind interface, motion planning, extended Kalman filters, electromechanical control systems, basic FPGA design, etc.\n\nI am a self taught programmer, but I have a much stronger focus in algorithms and their analysis than that makes me sound. The only formal university courses I have taken are a first class on discrete structures, a first class on data structures, digital logic design (I built an 8 bit computer!), and a graduate level GPGPU computing course. I got an A+ in each, and switched majors when I realized the computer science and computer engineering programs at my university were diploma mills and not at all challenging. They have basically nothing to offer me, even at the graduate level. Thankfully, the physics program at my university is very mathematically intensive (even compared to other physics programs), despite not being very highly ranked.\n\nI have taken online classes through MIT OpenCourseWare, Coursera, and elsewhere in machine learning, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, linear algebra/statistics, GPGPU computing, and many other things. My ability to self-teach as my strongest strength. I am really focusing the next year on developing an even stronger independent work ethic: where I can not just self-study a subject, but actually *work* my way through the problems in the standard literature on a subject without any outside direction.\n\nI am particularly interested in computer vision and machine learning. I have read a few books on the subject, and am trying to put together a curriculum for myself to prep for grad school. I will be getting a PhD. I say this because I am chasing erudition, not because I believe it is strictly a good return on investment. I don't really care for money, beyond financial security and the freedom to travel.\n\n&amp;&amp;\n\n&amp;&amp;\n\nIs a masters in computer science taken online worth anything? I am only considering it because of the name of the school attached (Georgia Tech). If your answer is \"it is what you make out of it\", then I have no worries. I am driven, and extremely studious.\n\nWhat other online masters programs are worth considering?\n\nBy unfortunate happenstance the two weakest areas in my undergraduate transcript are linear algebra and probability/statistics. I have been, and will be, doing everything I can to fix this before graduation. Specifically, I have done a lot of independent study, I will take upper-level electives not required for my degree program, and I will get high marks in them. What else can I do to prove my mathematical preparation?\n\nSearching through /r/machinelearning I see Kaggle brought up frequently. Any other ideas on what I can do to prepare myself for graduate school?\n\nI am doubtlessly missing some of the background of someone with a CS/CPE degree. What can I best do to fix this; what are the most important things to take away from an undergraduate degree? I will also be talking to the people at Georgia Tech asking them specifically what they would like to see on my transcript. \n\nWhat are the biggest questions I am not asking? What general advice do you have? What are the best resources for me to know about?","media":null}

I am not an expert in machine learning but an avid futurist and love thinking about the disruptive impact AI will have on our future. I thought this might be of interest to you.\n\n\nAn important factor of intelligence is the ability to analyze all potential decisions and their outcomes quickly and then make the decision that has the highest probability of achieving one's goals.\n\n\nFor example: We as humans make a choice of whether or not to go to a networking event. This may help us obtain a job in 5 years. Instead of going to the networking event we could have read a book or gone to lunch with friends. The book might give us an idea for a startup and lunch with friends might strengthen our relationship and make us happier.\n\n\n\nThe amount of time we spend thinking about a decision is based on how important it is. We don't spend much time thinking about where to go to lunch because it will not have a huge impact on our lives in 5 years but we do spend a lot of time thinking about the university we will attend because it has a huge impact on our future.\n\n\nFor example the decision of whether to go to Subway or McDonalds for lunch would be of minor importance - you would look a month into the future. Is the 1,000 calorie Big Mac going to add too many calories and make you lose the flat stomach for the upcoming Spring Break trip or is it worth the extra happiness to eat those delicious fries. A decision of which university to attend would be critically important and you would look 70 years into the future calculating how the location would impact happiness, how alumni might impact future career opportunities and if current student have similar interests as you.\n\n\nCould quantum computing be used by AI to make better decisions and improve it's intelligence? It would cap how far it would calculate future outcomes based on the relative importance of the decision.","retrieved_on":1441889018,"ups":0,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":2,"id":"1zcd5d","archived":true,"link_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"name":"t3_1zcd5d","author":"[deleted]","from":null,"is_self":true,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1zcd5d/thoughts_on_using_quantum_computing_to_increase/","secure_media":null,"from_kind":null,"created":1393765594,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","from_id":null,"stickied":false,"quarantine":false,"edited":false,"score":0}

I perform 5 trials which each shuffle the dataset, use half for training, and use 10 random samples of another 20% of the dataset (taken out of the other 50% portion) to test, finally averaging all the test scores of the 10 test sets.\n\nSo in the end I have five trials outputted, each of which *should* be completely independent and very similar. Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be the case. \n\nHere's an example of a run I just performed:\n\n.\n\nTrial 1:\n\nTime to build tree: 113.83 seconds\n\nF1: .3714\n\nCorrect: .7041\n\n.\n\nTrial 2:\n\nTime to build tree: 139.58 seconds\n\nF1: .3536\n\nCorrect: .699\n\n.\n\nTrial 3:\n\nTime to build tree: 142.68 seconds\n\nF1: .3479\n\nCorrect: .6962\n\n.\n\nTrial 4:\n\nTime to build tree: 145.17 seconds\n\nF1: .3384\n\nCorrect: .7027\n\n.\n\nTrial 5:\n\nTime to build tree: 160.54 seconds\n\nF1: .3123\n\nCorrect: .7187\n\n.\n\nAs you can see, each subsequent trial takes longer and has a lower f1 score.

It kind of got tricky with continuous data e.g. age? home market value? But I kind of arbitrarily split them into buckets e.g. Age less than 50 {0,1}?\n\nA software engineer working in market research described machine learning as finding patterns from large amounts data.

Ignoring the big hurdles of computer vision to understand the game state, and effectively re-writing the game to model all of the rules, just the logic is still a major problem.\n\nYou can read the rules on the [wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearthstone:_Heroes_of_Warcraft), or watch [a few matches](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE5ULrd5sr8). But it brings up many interesting problems:\n\n* Predicting what the opponent will play:\n\nThis could be done by having priors on the different types of decks for each class (or in arena mode, where one builds a deck from random given cards, for each card based on it' place in published ranking lists). Then update this by a Bayesian method, this would then inform the posterior on what the opponent has in the hand (though this is complicated, how do you produce a posterior for a (somewhat random) sample of 5 cards, from a MAP estimate for 30 cards?).\n\n* Holding back for better potential\n\nFor example, there is a card which deals 3 damage spread over random enemies. Some early players will use this on the first turn to deal 3 damage directly to the enemy hero (killing the enemy hero is how you win), but this is stupid, because it is incredibly unlikely that you'll be in a situation where you'd have won if you'd used the card early but are then able to do so. \n\nHowever, getting the AI to understand this is difficult, since if you just used a simple search over gamestates, then one where you did 3 damage is better than one where you don't. Of course you could add some cost to using cards, etc. but it seems a bit messy for something which seems so logical.\n\n* Weakly informative situations:\n\nFor example, if you play a very strong minion, and the enemy doesn't use a kill card (like polymorph, etc.) on it in their turn, then you can be certain that they don't have that card in their hand. This is another tricky thing to make use of.\n\n\nAnyway, I thought it was an interesting problem, I realise this probably makes no sense whatsoever if you haven't played the game.\n","retrieved_on":1441884297,"ups":3,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/1zm4dp/ai_planning_and_hearthstone/","link_flair_text":null,"author":"[deleted]","from":null,"is_self":true,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":5,"id":"1zm4dp","archived":true,"gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t3_1zm4dp","quarantine":false,"score":3,"edited":false,"created":1394011663,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","from_kind":null,"secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1zm4dp/ai_planning_and_hearthstone/","from_id":null,"stickied":false}

Then one would apply the model to the real-time date.\n\nI see customer (player) change in behavior as the most important aspect (demographics and other static parameters seem to have little information). So, I am trying to get time-series data into the mix.  However, it also occurs to me that the probabilities of churn associated with each player should emerge, not be retrained at each iteration. So, I would set new player likelihood to be equal to the baseline churn, but thereafter the prior probability at each iteration (daily batches) would be the previous day's forecast.  The probability would then be updated based on the observed behaviour.\n\nAs far as I can tell, this is common practice with Bayesian statistics, however, it doesn't seem to be a common way of applying naive bayes in machine learning.  Can anyone point me to either research or examples that show what I am doing is clearly not novel or discuss why my approach isn't currently used?\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated!\n\n","media":null,"ups":1,"retrieved_on":1441874731,"author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1394572364","subreddit":"MachineLearning","media_embed":{},"hide_score":false,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"distinguished":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"Emerging probabilites in Naive Bayes rather than static priors; am I on the right track or lost in the woods?"}

I don't have enough knowledge about CV/ML to fully understand the problem domain and potential solutions, so I thought I'd come here for advice!\n\n**Background:**\n\nI have 30k images containing handwritten text. They are all in English, have similar features in the fact the background color and text heavily contrast, and there is very little noise in general. Almost all of the images were written by different people with unique handwriting. Each photo is 600x600px and contains anything from a single word, up to a short paragraph. 10k of the images have been manually analyzed. I have the extracted text for these 10k images available for use as a training set.\n\n**Problem:**\n\nI'd like to be able to script the extraction of text for the remaining 20k images.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n-Is it possible to achieve accuracy of 95% on this problem with the current state of OCR/IWR/ICR?\n\n-I've looked at some open source OCR solutions, but most seem to not have great handwriting recognition options. Are there any FOSS projects that would fit this? I looked at tesseract but I read somewhere that for handwriting, most academics were able to get at most 90%.\n\n-Are there any proprietary APIs out there that could help with this? I don't want to buy a big enterprise product, I just need to be able to POST an image to an endpoint and get back the text.\n\n-Other ideas on how to tackle this problem? I thought about taking the output of the OCR/IWR program and use some sort of NLP technique to further improve accuracy, but this will in be possible in some cases.\n\nThanks in advance!\n","domain":"self.MachineLearning","hide_score":false,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"MachineLearning","created_utc":"1394860718","author_flair_text":null,"title":"API/OSS for processing handwriting to text?","secure_media_embed":{},"distinguished":null,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","stickied":false,"secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/20gob1/apioss_for_processing_handwriting_to_text/","subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","created":1394864318,"from_kind":null,"from_id":null,"quarantine":false,"score":0,"edited":false,"archived":true,"id":"20gob1","gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t3_20gob1","saved":false,"over_18":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":0,"is_self":true,"author":"aMLnoob","from":null}

Every one of the major MOOC sites offers\nnot only one but several good Machine Learning classes, so please check\n [coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), [edX](https://www.edx.org/), \n [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) yourself to see which ones are interesting to you.\n \n\nHowever, there are a few that stand out, either because they're very popular\nor are done by people who are famous for their work in ML. Roughly in order \nfrom easiest to hardest, those are:\n\n* Andrew Ng's [ML-Class at coursera](https://www.coursera.org/course/ml): Focused\n on application of techniques. Easy to understand, but mathematically very shallow.\n Good for beginners!\n\n* Hasti/Tibshirani's [Elements of Statistical Learning](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/): Also aimed at beginners and focused more on applications.\n\n* Yaser Abu-Mostafa's [Learning From Data](https://www.edx.org/course/caltechx/caltechx-cs1156x-learning-data-1120):\n Focuses a lot more on theory, but also doable for beginners\n \n* Geoff Hinton's [Neural Nets for Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/course/neuralnets):\n As the title says, this is almost exclusively about Neural Networks. \n\n* Hugo Larochelle's [Neural Net lectures](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6Xpj9I5qXYEcOhn7TqghAJ6NAPrNmUBH):\n Again mostly on Neural Nets, with a focus on Deep Learning \n\n* Daphne Koller's [Probabilistic Graphical Models](https://www.coursera.org/course/pgm)\n  Is a very challenging class, but has a lot of good material that few of the other\n  MOOCs here will cover\n \n -------------------\n\n\n**Books**\n\n\nThe most often recommended textbooks on general Machine Learning are (in no particular order):\n\n * Bishop's [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/cmbishop/prml/)\n * Hasti/Tibshirani/Friedman's [Elements of Statistical Learning](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/) *FREE VERSION ONLINE*\n * Barber's [Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning](http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Barber/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Brml.HomePage) *FREE VERSION ONLINE*\n * Murphy's [Machine Learning: a Probabilistic Perspective](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/MLbook/)\n * MacKay's [Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms](http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/itila/book.html) *FREE VERSION ONLINE*\n \nNote that these books delve deep into math, and might be a bit heavy for complete beginners. If you don't care so much about derivations or how exactly the methods work but would rather just apply them, then the folllowing are good practical intros:\n\n* [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/)  *FREE VERSION ONLINE*\n* Machine Learning for Hackers, \n* Machine Learning in Action\n* Machine Learning with R\n* [Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Methods for Hackers](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/blob/master/Prologue/Prologue.ipynb)  *FREE VERSION ONLINE*\n* Building Machine Learning Systems with Python\n\n(I've\n stolen most of the books in this 2nd list from /u/rvprasad's post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1wda3y/best_intro_to_ml_books/cf0xmyn)).\n \n\n There are of course a whole plethora on books that only cover specific subjects, \n as well as many books about surrounding fields in Math. A very good list has\n been collected by /u/ilsunil [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1jeawf/machine_learning_books/)\n \n\n -------------------\n\n\n**Programming Languages and Software**\n\n\nIn general, the most used languages in ML are probably Python, R and Matlab (with the latter\nlosing more and more ground to the former two). Which one suits you better\ndepends wholy on your personal taste. For R, a lot of functionality is either\nalready in the standard library or can be found through various packages in\nCRAN. For Python, NumPy/SciPy are a must. From there, [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org)\ncovers a broad range of ML methods. \n\nIf you just want to play around a bit and don't do much programming yourself\nthen things like [WEKA](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/), [KNIME](http://www.knime.org/)\nor [RapidMiner](http://rapidminer.com/) might be of your liking. Word of caution:\na lot of people in this subreddit are very critical of WEKA, so even though\nit's listed here, it is probably not a good tool to do anything more than\njust playing around a bit. A more detailed discussion can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1rwj8p/why_are_python_r_so_much_more_popular_here_than/)\n\n\n -------------------\n\n**Datasets and Challenges for Beginners**\n\n\nThere are a lot of good datasets here to try out your new Machine Learning skills.\n\n * [Kaggle](http://www.kaggle.com/) have a lot of challenges to sink your teeth into. Some even offer prize money!\n * The [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/) is a collection of a lot of good datasets\n * /r/datasets has a nice place to ask for data\n * http://blog.mortardata.com/post/67652898761/6-dataset-lists-curated-by-data-scientists lists some more datasets\n * [Here](http://www.quora.com/Data/Where-can-I-find-large-datasets-open-to-the-public) is a very extensive list of large-scale datasets of all kinds.\n * [Another dataset list](http://www.datawrangling.com/some-datasets-available-on-the-web)\n \n \n -------------------\n\n**Communities**\n\n* http://www.datatau.com/ is a data-science centric hackernews\n* http://metaoptimize.com/qa/ and http://stats.stackexchange.com/ are Stackoverflow-like discussion forums\n\n\n-------------------\n\n**ML Research**\n\nMachine Learning is a very active field of research. The two most prominent conferences are without a doubt [NIPS](http://nips.cc/) and [ICML](http://icml.cc).  Both sites contain the pdf-version of the papers accepted there, they're a great way to catch up on the most up-to-date research in the field. Other very good conferences include UAI (general AI), COLT (covers theoretical aspects)  and AISTATS.\n\nGood journals for ML papers are the [Journal of Machine Learning Research](http://jmlr.org/),  the [Journal of Machine Learning](http://www.springer.com/computer/ai/journal/10994) and [arxiv](http://arxiv.org).\n\n-------------------\n\n\n**Other sites and Tutorials**\n\n* http://datasciencemasters.org/ is an extensive list of lectures and textbooks for a whole Data Science curriculum\n* http://deeplearning.net/\n* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning\n* http://videolectures.net/Top/Computer_Science/Machine_Learning/\n\n\n\n**FAQ**\n\n\n *How much Math/Stats should I know?*\n\nThat depends on how deep you want to go. For a first exposure (e.g. Ng's\nCoursera class) you won't need much math, but in order to understand how the\nmethods really work,having at least an undergrad level of Statistics, Linear Algebra\nand Optimization won't hurt.","media":null,"ups":148,"retrieved_on":1441869071,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":31,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"name":"t3_20i0vi","gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"id":"20i0vi","archived":true,"from":null,"author":"BeatLeJuce","is_self":true,"from_id":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","from_kind":null,"created":1394916042,"secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/20i0vi/meta_collection_of_links_for_beginners_faq/","stickied":false,"edited":1397028380,"score":148,"quarantine":false}

Sorry for the long post. \n\nI went to top 5 CS university for grad school in a research focused program, and have a MS with major in ML/ NLP. I also published often in various conferences and was fortunate enough to have worked and authored with some big names in CS. \n\nUnfortunately my last paper was in mid 2011, and I drifted to working on my startup. It involved some NLP/ IR work, but a lot of it was grind work, and other non data-ish things that were quantitative in nature like image processing and combinatorial optimization. We have been mildly successful in terms of users, press and revenue. Though nothing spectacular by big exit standards.\n\nI had to recently move back to my home country due to family issues, and am no longer involved with the startup. Though I am helping the rest of the team transition for future product pipeline. And now I have to look for a more conventional job, which brings us to my questions. \n\nI have around six years of engineering experience post undergrad, split about evenly between academia/ research labs and the startup. Academia work also included working on live projects with sizable user base besides more pure experiments driven research work. But I have never worked in a normal corporate setting. And I also don't have a specialized engineering expertise. I have done everything from mobile[1] and web development to building recommender systems and optimizing elasticsearch to improve relevance. \n\n[1] This was primarily for the startup that included a very well reviewed app that was featured by Apple multiple times. Though I focused on harder algorithmic code and a team member lent hand for most UI/UX/API work.\n\nI would love some general advice for me. Also posting some specific questions here:\n\n- How much does my general background hurt my chances and for what roles? Does my experience in semi-managing technical teams help?\n\n- I am taking a break of a few months to realign my career; also doing some side projects. How badly is that viewed?\n\n- I have almost no knowledge of R/ SAS. Is it really important? Especially with the growth in scikit/ pandas community. Not great at them either, but am catching up fast.\n\n- Among broad data science tasks, I think I am least experienced in data munging. Any good pointers for that? I have started practicing on Kaggle. \n\n- I would prefer moving back to the US in near term. How hard would it be to interview directly there? I have reasonable contacts and an approved work visa, but not sure if someone will interview at all sitting on the opposite end of the world.\n\nThank you for the attention; x-posting to /r/datascience.\n","archived":true,"id":"20nkre","name":"t3_20nkre","link_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"num_comments":6,"author_flair_css_class":null,"is_self":true,"author":"diamond-merchant","from":null,"stickied":false,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/20nkre/moving_to_a_data_science_role_for_someone_with_a/","secure_media":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","from_kind":null,"created":1395089258,"from_id":null,"quarantine":false,"edited":1395086015,"score":0}

It couldn\u2019t be more straightforward. But at each step, Hofstadter argues, there\u2019s an analogy, a mental leap so stunningly complex that it\u2019s a computational miracle: somehow your brain is able to strip any remark of the irrelevant surface details and extract its gist, its \u201cskeletal essence,\u201d and retrieve, from your own repertoire of ideas and experiences, the story or remark that best relates.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cBeware,\u201d he writes, \u201cof innocent phrases like \u2018Oh, yeah, that\u2019s exactly what happened to me!\u2019 \u2026 behind whose nonchalance is hidden the entire mystery of the human mind.\u201d\n\nAfter reading, I decided I wanted to get a better look at this phenomenon, so I mentally leapt through a sequence of 'random' thoughts/images as quickly as I could, while taking note of the inherent connection they held in tandem with each other. As I watched this process, I noticed that as a thought arose, many little categorical markers would accompany it, the pool of which grew as certain patterns in the thought were noted. Once this pool grew great enough to distract from the initial thought, it would 'spill over' into a thought that shared a large subset of markers. It should be added that emotions guide the subset selection process greatly as well. The ratio of emotion to size in regards to the selection outcome would be difficult to observe as concentration meditation tends to quell emotions.\n\nNow, I've heard of people who come to realize through meditation, on one experiential level, that 'everything' is cause and effect. Daniel Ingram writes about this realization:\n\n&gt; ...if one is using a mantra, one may notice that at some point one shifts to being able to stay with mantra clearly and perceive it as an object, ... Once the mantra is clear, one may notice all sorts of things about the process of mentally creating the mantra, such as the stream of intentions being followed shortly behind by the string of the mantra itself follow slightly behind by the mental echo of the perception of the mantra, making what appear to be three separate streams of the mantra. This is direct insight into Cause and Effect\n\nEssentially, my mantra is that phenomenon. If I could observe a mantra closely enough to believe it's just cause and effect, then could I observe cause and effect the same way through this phenomenon? If a scientist could see clearly enough into the workings of the mind that they become convinced that 'everything' is cause and effect, would the mind then be known sufficiently enough for them to make great contributions in the field of machine learning? Has anyone out there already proved this true?","media":null,"ups":0,"retrieved_on":1441866150,"created_utc":"1395100521","author_flair_text":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"MachineLearning","domain":"self.MachineLearning","hide_score":false,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","distinguished":null,"title":"Could meditation on thought processes lead to breakthroughs in machine learning?","secure_media_embed":{}}

Should be done soon.\n\n* Worked as a research assistant putting together fiscal impact models (OLS, Time Series, 2SLS, 3SLS) and doing basic testing on them (things like granger causality, looking for heteroskedasticity, stationarity, all that but I mean I don't remember a lot of it. Used STATA so it was fairly...canned)\n\n* After/alongside my MS coursework I took a lot of mathematics, like 3 Real Analysis courses, a senior level Matrix Theory class, Abstract Algebra, Proofs (obviously for RA), ODE to see what was after calculus and did very, very well at that stuff, so I'm sound at abstraction.\n\n* Been working in IT for a year and 10 months or so. TL;DR my wife was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease and living as poor grad students was something I couldn't do to her any longer, so I took a good job with health insurance. \n\n* I do information security engineering for regulatory compliance controls on user accounts and computing environment. So it's half soft/business-y and half technical.* While doing this I was promoted early, learned SQL, Python, and R (not amazing at any of them but comfortable and love them all) to get some stuff done. SQL daily, Python weekly, R sparingly when people want me to look through their data or management wants metrics. Nothing killer, mostly GGPLOT and ODBC/SQL. I've played with Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib in Python but most of it is for automating regulatory compliance issues and reading/writing to SQL tables.\n\n* Currently taking Machine Learning on Coursera, planning to do the Specialization when it starts. \n\nThis week, one of the programmers on the team left, and I've been offered a spot on the development team since they know I like it and they can teach me to do it for 'real'. I've accepted since a) I love to learn and b) I think my quantitative and modeling background is solid, but my programming could use some improvement if I want to get into data science. It won't be *scientific* programming, but I'll become solid at Python, JS, SQL/NoSQL and working with different data structures like JSON and ugly flat files as well as working primarily in Linux.\n\nAm I doing this right? \n\nAside: I'm worried that by the time I'm 'done' with learning programming, the fad will have come to a head and the industry saturated and extremely competitive. I feel like I'm just *OK* at a lot of this stuff, but I love it all. That said, I don't want to be a pure programmer for life and will eventually of course need the quantitative component, since math/modeling/explaining things with math and modeling are my true interests. In a way, piping economics skills to things that aren't stereotypical like trading stocks.","domain":"self.MachineLearning","hide_score":false,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"MachineLearning","created_utc":"1395493150","author_flair_text":null,"title":"Am I setting myself up for success in landing a data science or similar job?","secure_media_embed":{},"distinguished":null,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"default","stickied":false,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/212ml9/am_i_setting_myself_up_for_success_in_landing_a/","secure_media":null,"from_kind":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","created":1395496750,"from_id":null,"quarantine":false,"score":0,"edited":1395493355,"id":"212ml9","archived":true,"link_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t3_212ml9","gilded":0,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":13,"is_self":true,"author":"[deleted]","from":null}

{"media":null,"selftext":"Greetings guys, and apologies in advance in case I posted this in the wrong subreddit.\n\n\nI'm really intrigued by the concept of HMM, and am trying to understand it by applying it in a small-vocabulary, speaker-dependent, isolated word recognizer. Did quite a lot of research, stumbled upon [this paper](https://www.google.com.ph/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CCoQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.netlearning2002.org%2Ffou%2Fcuppsats.nsf%2Fall%2Fe63c30f71dde8e8dc1257142004558b3%2F%24file%2FSpeech%2520Recognition%2520using%2520Hidden%2520Markov%2520Model_MEE_03_19.doc&amp;ei=kW8wU6_uHITVkAWxyIGABA&amp;usg=AFQjCNFVnj5P7RUq3vCAAgr9Df7BwbjBVA&amp;bvm=bv.62922401,d.dGI) and just straight-up copied their methods verbatim, hoping to get the same results in MATLAB. I've taken a couple of intro DSP courses but we never really got into the topic of speech recognition, but at least I already have some basic knowledge, and I believe that I have the preprocessing/feature vector extraction parts figured out.\n\n\nI've seen video tutorials (like [this one](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE6Wd9FR--Ecf_5nCbnSQMHqORpiChfJf) and [that one](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD0F06AA0D2E8FFBA)), studied other web documents (including [the seminal paper](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/Bayes/rabiner.pdf) from the patron saint of HMM ASR himself, L.R. Rabiner, cited in all other papers I've read); and I feel that I got a fair grasp on the general concepts, meanings of terms, and interpretations of equations.\n\n\nHowever, I get stuck at implementing the algorithms for training and testing. More precisely: I'm confused by the notations for the Baum-Welch re-estimation procedure, and the alternate Viterbi algorithm. I'd really appreciate if anyone could provide a simple illustration to help me wrap my head around the notation, something like a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithms, with dimensions of matrices used in each step.\n\n\nEDIT: For your consideration, here is [an annotated script detailing the parts that I understand so far](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8tbnglhstz8kzbr/train.m), for you to tear apart if you have the time.

I wasn't able to try this due to difficulties with the libraries and an extreme lack of time, but I will safely assume it won't work for some reason or people would just do this.\n\nHowever using the traditional method, how do I train the HMM on each class?

Quite often I had the feeling that I did only grasp the  statistics on a rather shallow level, mostly because of the lack of knowledge in more basic math. \n\nI choose to do psychological methods because I wanted to learn what it means to do \"good\" research and was interested on a more philosophical level in what it means to really \"know\" something and why a simple t-test was supposed to be the answer :). But in high school, I sucked at math. The things is: an eigenvalue in multivariate stats (PCA) course remained a voodoo concept for me. I just did not see the whole thing as an unified concept and soon lost interest out of frustration, learning means understanding to me and not memorization. How the heck are you suposed to rotate a coordinate system? :) And as usual, things that do not get understood on a deeper level, quickly fade away in memory. (If I cant code it/reproduce it/explain it, I forget it)\n\nLast year I decided that this way of learning does not satisfy me and that a PhD in psychology is not the right way to go for me. No one reads the papers anyway ;). I decided that I need a job, and since for me the most fun and interesting part of research has always been doing the analysis, the coding to clean up the data and making the plots (all in R), I want to do more of that and learn to work with bigger amounts of data. \n\nSo i learned calculus (from the book: Calculus and ints applications by Goldstein) and python.  Yesterday I finished an undergrad course in linear algebra from the comp science department of my university. I am planning to do a minor in programming and two courses in machine learning next semester (thought from the bishop book). I have already followed the course of andrew ng.  I have time till the beginning of next semester to suck up as much knowledge as I can to prepare for the machine learning courses and finally for the job market. What do you guys think is worth reading? Books on probability theory? Should I re-read my stats and calculus books? Should i delve into books about information theory? Learn SQL and data warehousing?\n\nDo you guys think it is realistic to get into an entry level position with my CV?\n\nI would be really thankful for some recommendations for a guy with my skill set and maybe some good resources for self-study. \n\nCheers!

Maybe some others can comment on why certain techniques converge and others fail to do so (in particular, networks with ReLU units).\n\n\n\nFirst, the data: I'm using a set of 8x8 whitened natural image patches.  You can get them from Bruno Olshausen's website:\n\n\nhttp://redwood.berkeley.edu/bruno/sparsenet/\n\n\n~~In addition to the whitening, I scaled and offset these images so that their values fell within the range of 0.2 - 0.8.~~\n\n\n**Edit:** This statement is only partially correct.  The data was scaled so that (if I recall correctly) it has a mean of 0.5 and a standard deviation of 0.1 (meaning that the data falls within 0.2-0.8 to within three standard deviations).  [Here is a histogram.](http://imgur.com/OaZnqzR)\n\n\nAll of these experiments involve an autoencoding task, where the network is asked to simply reproduce the input (the image data is vectorized, making a single 64-dimensional vector).\n\nYou can see all the results in an album here:\n\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/8g9ST\n\n\n\nLet's begin with regular old backpropagation, as you can find in books about neural networks from the 90's.  The network structure is 64-25-64, meaning the input and output layers have 64 neurons, and in between is a single 25-neuron hidden layer.  The neurons have a sigmoidal activation function.  We'll train it using Stochastic Gradient Descent, with the following parameters:\n\n\n* 3000 iterations with a learning step of 1.0.\n\n* 3000 iterations with a learning step of 0.1.\n\n* Minibatches of 100 examples.\n\n* Five gradient descent steps per minibatch.\n\n\nWhat comes out is a network that has an average per-pixel error of 0.031, which is pretty good.  However, if we look at [Figure 1](http://i.imgur.com/u8HH11W.png) on the image album, you can see a visualization of the weight matrix between the input and first hidden layer (each image is made up of the weights that are incident on a single neuron).  They are more structured than noise, but they still don't tell us much.\n\n\n\n\nNext, let's add a sparsity metric to the model, as well as some weight regularization.  Everything else stays the same, but now we penalize neurons for having activations that deviate from a target value (in our case, 0.01), and also penalize weights for growing too large.  The technique used below is detailed here: \n\nhttp://deeplearning.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/Autoencoders_and_Sparsity \n\n\nSee [Figure 2](http://i.imgur.com/JrsOzOS.png) for a picture of the weights that emerge after training.  Average error per pixel is 0.88, so we've lost some performance.  The weights seem to be trending toward edge detectors, but they aren't there yet.  What happens if we keep everything the same, but train the model for twice as many iterations (6000 at each step size)?  See [Figure 3](http://i.imgur.com/QcawaEJ.png).  That's more like it.  Average error is now 0.083.  Getting better.\n\n\nSo, great.  Can we do better?  It turns out we can.  RMSProp is a variant of SGD, and when combined with Nesterov momentum, can converge very quickly.  [Figure 4](http://i.imgur.com/yriPReW.png) shows the result we get when we train the same network, with the same sparsity and weight regularization parameters, for 3000 iterations of RMSProp.  Average error is 0.076.  That's the best so far.  \n\n\n\nCan we do better still?  There are three things left to try that involve eschewing the idea of sparsity penalties during training altogether.  A technique called Dropout involves simply removing half the neurons during each minibatch.  [Figure 5](http://i.imgur.com/AhEl6js.png) shows the result we turn off all the sparsity and regularization, and implement dropout.  It looks a little like Figure 1.  The average error per pixel is 0.069.  We're still using sigmoidal units and SGD, and we're still training from 6000 iterations using a learning step of 1.0 and another 6000 steps at 0.1.  This is the best performance observed for a model that is attempting to be sparse, but we don't see edge detectors in the weights.  Why?\n\n\n\nNext, let's add a different type of weight regularization.  Instead of simply penalizing weights for growing too large, let's threshold weights based on the L2 norm of all the weights feeding into a hidden neuron.  If the L2 norm passes a threshold, the weights are scaled so that the threshold is no longer broken.  [Figure 6](http://i.imgur.com/4ec08n1.png) shows the result when we threshold the weights to 1.0.  These look much more like edge detectors.  The average error per pixel for SGD, dropout, and weight regularization is 0.087.  Dropout seems to have a strong interacting with weight regularization.  \n\n\nFinally, we can try using Rectified Linear Units (ReLU) instead of sigmoids.  [Figure 7](http://i.imgur.com/zexXfeE.png) shows the network trained with SGD, dropout, L2-norm weight regularization, and ReLU units.  Not so good anymore.  The average error per pixel is 0.41-- The output is barely better than noise.  \n\n\n\nWhat went wrong?  Maybe the regularization threshold was set too low.  [Figure 8](http://i.imgur.com/VoXzLkP.png) shows the result when the threshold is set to 5.0.  Almost identical.  The error is still 0.41.  \n\n\n\nMaybe ReLU units are only effective on large, deep networks and not small ones?  [Figure 9](http://i.imgur.com/xWQSRT8.png) shows the result when the network size is changed from 64-25-64 to 64-50-50-50-64 (other than that, the same configuration as figure 7 is used).  The weights between the input and first hidden layer are shown.  It looks like a few copies of one edge detector might be emerging, but it doesn't look like very much is being learned.  \n\n\n\n\nSo what is the story with ReLU units?
