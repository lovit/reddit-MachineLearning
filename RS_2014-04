Not noticing enough content lately. I've decided to lead a review of Yann LeCun's more recent arxiv papers available here: \n\n\nhttp://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6229.pdf\n\n\n**Abstract:**\n\n\nWe present an integrated framework for using Convolutional\nNetworks for classi-\nfication, localization and detection. We show how a multisca\nle and sliding window\napproach can be efficiently implemented within a ConvNet. We\nalso introduce a\nnovel deep learning approach to localization by learning to\npredict object bound-\naries. Bounding boxes are then accumulated rather than supp\nressed in order to\nincrease detection confidence. We show that different tasks\ncan be learned simul-\ntaneously using a single shared network. This integrated fr\namework is the winner\nof the localization task of the ImageNet Large Scale Visual R\necognition Challenge\n2013 (ILSVRC2013) and obtained very competitive results fo\nr the detection and\nclassifications tasks. In post-competition work, we establ\nish a new state of the art\nfor the detection task. Finally, we release a feature extrac\ntor from our best model\ncalled OverFeat.\n\n\nReview:\n\n\n**Pros of this network:** \n\n\n- Boosts classification, localization, and detection accuracy when they all feed off of each other in the same network.\n- Proven in competitions to be the best method out there\n- Basically a massively efficient bruteforce approach to localization, it's using 3 seperate streams, (D,L,R) but with the same, as already prove, very powerful feature extraction network. \n\n**Cons:**\n\n\n- lots of labelled data still required. \n- I'm sure it requires massive amounts of work to implement and train properly. \n- It looks like in their results they have trained many models and selected the best one.\n- Requires lots of hardware to reproduce experiment and to compete\n\n\n**Method review**\n\n\n- Most interested in how they do localization, their classification is the same as it always was. The prediction of the localization helps regress towards the most prominent thing in the scene, therefore reducing errors. \n- Localization is done by training a regression layer ontop of the conv net feature producing layers to predict the location of the object. \n- Sliding window approach to generate a bunch of confidence values for each window. The windows are regressed to the most common/strongest confidence area. \n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\nMachine Learning Paper Review, Thursday April 10: **Le Cam meets LeCun: Deficiency and Generic Feature Learning** Link: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.4884.pdf\n\n\n**Abstract:**\n\n\u201cDeep Learning\u201d methods attempt to learn generic features in an unsupervised fashion from a large\nunlabelled data set. These generic features should perform as well as the best hand crafted features\nfor any learning problem that makes use of this data. We provide a definition of generic features,\ncharacterize when it is possible to learn them and provide algorithms closely related to the deep\nbelief network and autoencoders of deep learning. In order to do so we use the notion of deficiency\ndistance and illustrate its value in studying certain general learning problems.\n\n\n**Review**:\n\n\n  When I read through and saw 27 pages, holey thats a lot! The first 8 pages are a re-iteration and formalization of what most of you already know (supervised learning, active learning, etc) and explained by their defined quintuple of the learning problem. The last 15 pages are proofs of theorems. That being said, the most interesting part is something I can't understand because it has to do with statistics (deficiency and such) described in these papers. The most interesting results are on page 6 and 7, section 3.2 and section 4 respectively. The paper also formally describes when generic feature learning can be used, and when supervised learning is better.\n\n\n**Questions**: Could any statistician describe what \"Factoring through\" and \"Deficiency\" are? My hypothesis of deficiency is the lack of data required to close the gap between the optimal function, thus the learned hypothesis is \"data deficient\". \n___________________________________________________________________________________________\n","permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/22iep9/daily_paper_review_overfeat_integrating/","link_flair_text":null,"is_self":true,"author":"MLPaperReviews","from":null,"archived":true,"id":"22iep9","link_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t3_22iep9","gilded":0,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"num_comments":4,"author_flair_css_class":null,"quarantine":false,"edited":1397120770,"score":38,"stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","created":1396963963,"from_kind":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/22iep9/daily_paper_review_overfeat_integrating/","secure_media":null,"from_id":null}

{"media":null,"selftext":"I've been reading lots of articles on machine learning and its applications. Often there will be some article that says something like, this little-known connection was discovered and used to find a new market/application etc.\n\nSo I've started to recognize that pattern in articles. Like for example, [this one](http://techcrunch.com/2013/08/14/avantcredit-raises-20m-to-grow-its-machine-powered-online-lending-platform/) talks about targeting people who are likely to miss some loan payments.\n\nThen I read [this](http://blogs.citypaper.com/index.php/arts-and-minds/accused-baltimore-hitman-already-done-number-contract-murders-court-document-says/):\n\n&gt;In his dealings with the CW, Smith \u201cemphasized his desire\u201d to murder his target \u201cin the city rather than in Baltimore County\u201d\u2014a reflection, perhaps, on the relative odds of getting caught. The city\u2019s homicide squad closes about half or less of their murder investigations with arrests, while Baltimore County closes about nine out of 10 cases. \n\nIt struck me as something out of one of those \"this is how Target can tell you're pregnant\" articles.\n\nNow, it doesn't take a machine-learning algorithm to determine the best place to carry out a murder, but it can't hurt.\n\nJust wondering what sort of unprofessional or even evil ideas have you've had for machine learning and predictive/pattern recognition applications. Something short of murder would be nice to discuss, like winning the lottery, or cheating at online poker, or getting the most likes on facebook, or successful online dating or finding the best parking spots or something like that. Think like a Bat Man Villain.\n\nFor the record, murder is clearly _evil_ without quotes, but I want the discussion to be about \"_evil_\" with quotes.\n\nApologies if you're all too serious for this.

It had to do with skipping the 0th epoch. Instead of comparing to t+1 target, I just had to compare to t+2 because of the way I was skipping.\n\nHi guys, I'm currently trying to get a LSTM network to predict a text sequence. My version doesn't have a forget gate or a scaling function for the cell output. I use tanh as the activation function for all nodes except the output layer which is using a logarithmic softmax function. I have one hidden layer of 250 LSTM cells. The input and output layers are both of size 28 (26 for letters, 1 for space, and 1 for '). The training data is currently only about 250 characters. \n\nMy problem is that once the network gets past outputting gibberish, it only predicts the previous target. The current code is at https://gist.github.com/anonymous/10404161\n\nThe things I'm confused about that I think could be causing this problem are that I don't really understand the inputs in a given epoch. Currently, I'm skipping the 0th prediction because the papers I read didn't specify how to evaluate y(t-1) if t = 0. So I'm starting at t=1, assuming that every output at t=0 is 0. \n\nI'm also not entirely sure that my gradient descent is perfect, but since the network seems to learn some coherent function, I think it might not be the direct cause of the improper predictions. \n\nI'm really sorry if my question is horribly worded because my understanding of the material is shitty enough, so trying to explain it is very hard for me. \n\nThe paper's I've been reading are: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.0850v3.pdf, http://www.bioinf.jku.at/publications/older/2604.pdf, http://machinelearning.wustl.edu/mlpapers/paper_files/GersSS02.pdf\n\nEDIT:Changing the code only so that it starts at the 0th epoch instead of the 1st results in the program alternatively predicting spaces and one of a few different letters. I'm not sure if this means there is a problem with my gradient descent since the network seems to get stuck on local optima.","media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/22pdgr/trouble_with_rnn_predicting_previous_input_for/","title":"Trouble with RNN predicting previous input for time series","secure_media_embed":{},"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","distinguished":null,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","hide_score":false,"created_utc":"1397147724","author_flair_text":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"MachineLearning"}

Hopefully, these bi-weekly contests will help us refine our knowledge and practice new skills. I think it will be a nice thing both for beginners and those people who want to try something new or exchange experience.\n\n**THE TASK**\n\nIn this challenge, we'll face a classification problem.  The data set is made of gray-scale pictures of cars. Half of them show cars ( positive example ) and half of them do not ( negative example ). All pictures are in the \".pgm\" format. You can use pgmview or other free software to view them.\n\nPositive examples:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/LJoeZuC.png\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Nggvd5U.png\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ywEa7iD.png\n\nNegative examples:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/f5XBQ5O.png\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/WUkL1MJ.png\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/XHPVXzf.png\n\n**DATA SET DOWNLOAD**\n\n\nThe data set comes from here ( http://cogcomp.cs.illinois.edu/Data/Car/ ) - I've had to modify it slightly ( thanks **alecradford** for the information ) I've also included pgm viewer so you can view the images before you do anything.\n\nThe data can be downloaded from here:\n\n (https://www.dropbox.com/s/2mg9i6m0gvb8byu/car-detection.rar)\n\n**CHALLENGE RULES**\n\n\n* Our task is to differentiate whether the picture contains a car or not. \n\n\n* You should train your model on the data from the \"training-set\" directory and then validate your results on images from the \"test-set\" folder. Training models on Test Data is forbidden ( for obvious reasons ).\n\n\n* Your task is to achieve as high classification accuracy as possible. \n\n\n* This challenge will accept new contenders up to 24th of April 2014. \n\n\n* You can post your results in comments - along with your method and preferably code so others can replicate and confirm your results. You can edit your post at any time you want, posting your results doesn't prohibit you from updating them when you improve your solution. Moreover, you can post multiple solutions that use different methods!\n\n\n* The person with the best solution wins. After this challenge ends, I will create a post that summarizes the results ( along with a \"leader board\" - to show each solution accuracy. )\n\n\nFeel free to get to work - you can use this thread to demonstrate your progress and discuss other solutions. It would be really nice if someone could make a sticky of this.","media":null,"ups":43,"retrieved_on":1441585549}

These generic features should perform as well as the best hand crafted features for any learning problem that makes use of this data. We provide a definition of generic features, characterize when it is possible to learn them and provide algorithms closely related to the deep belief network and autoencoders of deep learning. In order to do so we use the notion of deficiency distance and illustrate its value in studying certain general learning problems.\n\n**Review:**\n\nWhen I read through and saw 27 pages, holey thats a lot! The first 8 pages are a re-iteration and formalization of what most of you already know (supervised learning, active learning, etc) and explained by their defined quintuple of the learning problem. The last 15 pages are proofs of theorems. That being said, the most interesting part is something I can't understand because it has to do with statistics (deficiency and such) described in these papers. The most interesting results are on page 6 and 7, section 3.2 and section 4 respectively. The paper also formally describes when generic feature learning can be used, and when supervised learning is better.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n\n Could any statistician describe what \"Factoring through\" and \"Deficiency\" are? My hypothesis of deficiency is the lack of data required to close the gap between the optimal function, thus the learned hypothesis is \"data deficient\".

So I've managed to get a hold of a collection of voter files for a few different states. They're pretty messy, lots of missing fields, heterogeneous types (binary, floats, chars, and factors). Also, each file is decently sized at about a 1gb. The objective is going to be predicting the likelihood of a given individual turning out to vote in the midterm elections. With that said, I'd be interested in hearing how you all would approach this problem. \n\nThis isn't one of those \"what's the best algorithm for all the problems\" questions, I'm just curious as to how you all would approach this specific problem.  Given that the data set is both wide and deep plus the need for a relatively scalable model, my first instinct would be to use a random forest.

I guess first of all, my understanding of what the section is actually trying to accomplish is pretty weak. My understanding is that given a sequence of pen strokes, the network should be able to predict the future pen stroke locations. \n\nMy major problem though is understanding how to create the input vectors for the predicted part. Is the probability density (eq 23) only useful for the training part?

{"retrieved_on":1441575562,"ups":2,"media":null,"selftext":"I'm trying to create a network that predicts handwriting strokes. I've got a network consisting of a 3d input vector (x coord, y coord, and the probability that the point is the last point in a stroke), a hidden layer of 900 long short term memory cells, and an output layer of size 121 (20 bivariate mixture components and 1 for the end-of-stroke probability). \n\nI think my code accurately reflects the algorithm outlined in the paper I'm reading, http://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.0850v3.pdf. Assuming my code is correct, I'm still having an extremely difficult time getting the numbers to stay within a normal range. \n\nOne problem I've been having is that an equation involves raising e to the power of the summed inputs of an output node. With 900 incoming inputs, it's very likely that the resulting number will be too large. I sidestepped this problem in a previous architecture by dividing the input by 1000 or taking the log of the whole thing instead. \n\n~~Another problem I'm having is that the correlation (between the x1 and x2 of a given mixture component - I'm honestly not too sure because I'm not good at stats) starts to approach -1 or 1 which results in a division-by-zero error in calculating the probability density. I've tried looking at other papers on mixture density networks, but their notation is kind of confusing and there are certainly major differences in their equations and the one in the paper I'm using.~~\n\nUpon further review, it appears that the problem of converging correlations is a symptom of the increasingly large summed inputs to the output nodes. The correlations = tanh(sum_input). Since the sums continue to increase, the correlations converge to (+/-)1. I don't know how to prevent the sums from increasing so much, should I use a log sum or is this just pushing the problem further down the line?\n\nA somewhat unrelated problem (I think at least) that I've experienced with pretty much any project I've worked on lately is how much time it takes to train the network. With this current network there are about 3 million weights that need to be updated every timestep (as per the network's design; I don't know what would happen if I did updates every 1000 steps etc). A single pen stroke corresponds mostly to a single letter or at most a small word written in cursive. This single pen stroke looks like it'll take my network 25000 seconds to train on. Is it impossible for me to somehow expedite this process?\n\nTLDR:How can I guarantee that my weights and outputs remain within a certain numerical range without ruining the integrity of the network? Also, how can I best get around time bottlenecks caused both by network size and data size?\n\nI'm sorry if my problem is poorly worded or if I didn't provide enough information. Please let me know if you want me to clarify anything.","permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/23b33b/trouble_stabilizing_mixture_density_network/","link_flair_text":null,"title":"Trouble stabilizing mixture density network","secure_media_embed":{},"distinguished":null,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","domain":"self.MachineLearning","hide_score":false,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"MachineLearning","created_utc":"1397773230","author_flair_text":null,"quarantine":false,"edited":1397780881,"score":2,"stickied":false,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/23b33b/trouble_stabilizing_mixture_density_network/","secure_media":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","from_kind":null,"created":1397776830,"from_id":null,"is_self":true,"author":"purpleladydragons","from":null,"archived":true,"id":"23b33b","gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t3_23b33b","saved":false,"over_18":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":0}

His early OCR and text-to-speech synthesis work has been labeled as seminal and won him many [awards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Kurzweil#Praise).  Moreover, he claims to have 'pioneered' Hidden Markov Models and champions them as still the best model for the brain's hierarchical representations ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zihTWh5i2C4), around 33 minutes in).  However, I've never seen him cited in any serious technical literature.  I gather that most of his influence is isolated to futurism, and even that facet of his work has been often criticized, most notably by [Paul Allen](http://www.technologyreview.com/view/425733/paul-allen-the-singularity-isnt-near/) and [John Rennie](http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/ray-kurzweils-slippery-futurism/1).

I also tried going through The Analytics Edge Edx course, but didn't really like it that much. I am really interested in learning about machine learning algorithms and their development. The Edx course involved more of analysis of data using R, but I seemed to learn very little about how to design or program any of these algorithms. \nRight now I am torn between what to do after I finish Andrew Ng's course, there is an entire specialization offered in Coursera by John Hopkins for data science using R, but it would take up my entire time, and I am worried that I may not enjoy it much considering my previous experience with the EdX course.\n\nThen there are also all the other resources on machine learning, like Daphne Koller's PGM course, Geoffrey Hinton's NN course, Andrew Ng's Stanford 229 lectures, Abu Mostofa's course, also various resources on Probability and Linear Algebra, which seem far more interesting to me. However I am worried that I may be missing out on important things if I skip the John Hopkins data science courses, especially since they are offering a capstone project at the end, which would be really useful for someone trying to break into the field from another one(In my case it's electronics engineering and QA in IT).\n\nI am also planning on going to Grad School next year, and really don't know what courses to look into, since I don't really know what the field I am interested in is called. \n\nAlso, in /r/BigDataJobs, they mention two related subreddits, one for machine learning jobs, one for data science. So ultimately is there a practical difference when on a job hunt, where there are some positions that involve mainly machine learning, while others require more of data science? \n\nSo, to summarize, I am interested in the research and development of learning algorithms, and also programming in general, however I am not sure how much of this is supposed to be machine learning, and what is supposed to be data science. This is a problem, since I don't what resources to study next, and also don't know which courses to look into for grad school. \n\nI think this post may seem a bit disordered, I am quite a bit confused regarding these matters, could someone please help sort these things out for me?","hide_score":false,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","subreddit":"MachineLearning","media_embed":{},"author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1397875215","secure_media_embed":{},"title":"Machine Learning vs Data Science?","distinguished":null,"thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"stickied":false,"created":1397878815,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","from_kind":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/23eq2e/machine_learning_vs_data_science/","secure_media":null,"from_id":null,"quarantine":false,"score":5,"edited":false,"archived":true,"id":"23eq2e","gilded":0,"name":"t3_23eq2e","link_flair_css_class":null,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":14,"is_self":true,"author":"EvilPsychoticPenguin","from":null}

Specifically, I want to create a program that takes text (likely in .pdf or .doc formats) and convert it into a series of questions and answers.\nFor example, given the following:\n&gt;text- The capital of Canada is Ottawa. converted into Q&amp;A format\n&gt;Q: What is the capital of Canada? \n&gt;A: What capital of Canada is Ottawa.\nAny suggestions for starting this would be GREATLY appreciated.

[This answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/22498940/1277472), in particular, I found interesting. The accepted answer was decent, but the answer linked above used expectimax, an efficient 64-bit board representation, lookup tables, a transposition table, and a simpler heuristic, and managed to achieve a far higher score (routinely managing to obtain at least one 8192 tile).\n\nI recently ported this solution to Java, and with a few small modifications, it seems to make it to 16384 fairly frequently, though it runs at about half the speed of the original C++ implementation.\n\nSo, the two glaring flaws of expectimax are the gigantic branching factor and the need for a human-programmed heuristic to evaluate any given board/state. A speed of 3 moves per second isn't very good -- it maxes out my CPU for an hour to play through a single game. And though it's managed to reach 16384, the 64-bit board representation can go up to 32768 (and technically, it is possible, however unlikely, to reach 65536 and 131072).\n\nIt seems that reinforcement learning is a better solution, if I understand correctly. The AI would train itself, approximating a heuristic based on playing the game over and over, using solely the game's official score as a benchmark, and would calculate moves very quickly. The downside being the training required.\n\nA few questions:\n\n- Is my analysis of the advantages/disadvantages of these two approaches reasonably accurate?\n- How might I go about utilizing reinforcement learning? I've seen Q learning with a neural network as a function approximator being brought up in my Googling -- how exactly does that work, and would it produce a better-than-expectimax AI in a reasonable amount of time?\n- Is there some other, far superior approach that I'm overlooking?\n\nAlso, any insights on the expectimax approach and 2048 in general would be awesome. Monotonicity, smoothness, and free tiles are really the only heuristics that have popped up. Other than nneonneo's various optimizations, I threw in some concurrency -- but it seems that's still not enough to overcome the disadvantage of using Java. Since the game has (in this representation) nearly 2^64 valid states, and reaching 16384 takes around 10000 moves, simplifications based on symmetry and similarity (in terms of things like monotonicity) would be great.","media":null,"ups":3,"retrieved_on":1441569854,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/23n9pt/reinforcement_learning_vs_expectimax_for_a_2048_ai/","thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"distinguished":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"Reinforcement Learning vs. Expectimax for a 2048 AI","author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1398133645","subreddit":"MachineLearning","media_embed":{},"hide_score":false,"domain":"self.MachineLearning"}

I'll leave the question up for possible future users who might have the same problem. My answer:Define every non-existent connection to be 0. Since every p value at t=0 is 0, p(1) is totally dependent on the second term in the summation. This is only non-0 if i = k, i.e the p(1) value of unit k is only non-0 if j connects to unit k. Most p(1) values will still be 0, but some of them will have non-0 p(2) values if they connect to a unit with non-0 p(1) value. By induction, this phenomenon spreads throughout the network until all non-input units have a non-0 p value for any given connection.

However, I am not exactly sure how to calculate the TD error to back-propagate through my neural network to adjust the weights.\n\nThe way I have the neural net setup is the following: the inputs correspond to some binary information about the world around Mario, specifically in a 5x5 tile grid that has binary information like, hasMonster, isBlock, isCoin, etc. I also feed some binary inputs like isMarioOnGround or canMarioJump into the net as well as a bias input. The output layer has six nodes, one for each button press that is possible (up, down, left, right, jump, speed/fireball). The input and output layers are fully connected to the hidden layer (currently I am using 10 nodes for single hidden layer). After each time step, along with the environment, I can get a current reward of Mario's performance (based on level progress, enemy kills, coins collected, blocks broken, etc).\n\nI believe temporal difference learning is the way to go with this problem, as the state space becomes intractable to store in a table with actions (for Q-Learning) and there already is a reward function defined for the framework. I am just having quite a bit of difficulty wrapping my head around the equations...\n\nHow do I calculate the TD error to back-propagate through my NN?

I found different suggestions in the website, but don't know if it fits the \"random\" events:\n\nPower low (Duane) model\nPoisson Model\nPoisson point process\nHidden Markov Model\ninhomogeneous Poisson process\nfrom what I know, the crucial assumption in the Poisson process is that what happens now is independent of what happened a moment ago or what will happen in the next moment (or at any other moment, for that matter). Therefore the distribution of events during any (measurable) period of time depends only on the length of time, not on how it is broken up.\n\nWhen it comes to \"crimes\", the events are independent. In this case, should I use Poisson model to predict \"crimes\". I think it's the same also for earth-quacks.

{"selftext":"Hello redditors,\n\nThis is not really a serious project, but there are a few things I would like to at least do right.\n\nSome friends and I started this library for the IT project because we thought it would be very exciting to teach computers to solve complex problems, and it turns out we were right.\n\nHowever, we are complete noobs regarding machine learning as we documented ourselves for only a few months, with mitigated results.\n\nSo far, I implemented a very simple, feed-forward neural network, using the vectorized versions of the feed forward and back propagations algorithms.\n\nAn other friends implemented some genetics algorithms on a neural network algorith that I ultimately had to rewrite, but I have my doubts on it's effectiveness as I couldn't really get outstanding results out of it.\n\nTruth to be told, I also have my doubts on the entire project as I had to fake some of the samples to meet some of our deadlines :/\nSo here we are, with a possibly working library (some confirmation on the algorithms implementations for the feed forward &amp; backpropagation would be great), and without any stable idea for what's next... One of my teammates said we could do vocal recognition, but holy hell am I right to fear how hard that will be given the situation, and considering we have no idea how to do so, and that we have a month to complete whatever we have to complete ?\n\nIf anyone with a progamming touch could check the [project](http://goo.gl/dgJW10), we would be grateful.\n\nThanks for reading.","media":null,"ups":4,"retrieved_on":1441560648,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/246lui/some_friends_and_i_made_a_simple_neural_network/","thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"distinguished":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"Some friends and I made a simple neural network library in C for an IT project, and we don't know where to continue.

Most replies usually seem to suggest reading through some well known books (such as the Elements of Statistical Learning - dense!) for a first read. Other suggestions have included taking one of several online courses. \n\nI worry that the sheer learning curve for entering this field can be a turn off to some people. Personally, I know it took me quite a few books and many, many late nights and weekends before I really started to get it to the point where I felt comfortable applying it to real problems. Fast forward roughly two years later, and I\u2019m using what I\u2019ve learned regularly in the R&amp;D department at a chemistry company. (My training is in computer science and materials engineering.)\n\nI written a few internal reports on various projects I\u2019ve worked on where I\u2019ve applied various machine learning techniques where traditional methods have failed. These reports have generated enough buzz that several colleagues have approached me to help them out with other projects their working on and to learn from me. Some of the sticking points I see for them is how little time they have to learn all of the various aspects of \u201cdoing data science\u201d. I\u2019d like to help them overcome these barriers by giving them small wins upfront by starting with model building using \"off the shelf\u201d software packages. I effectively want to get them doing data science like tasks such as generating models and making predictions on new data points so they can gain exposure to the process and see tangible results. I think a lot of the details can be filled in later as they become more comfortable with their new skills.\n\nWhat points of pain do people have when trying to learn about this topic? The lack of time seems to be a big one, and this is the reason I think something like FastML (but explained in a way that\u2019s more accessible to a larger audience) is a good recipe. I\u2019d like to know who else might benefit from something like this, and what other sticking points am I possibly overlooking?\n\nI want to take an 80/20 approach for a course like this, where big wins are gained up front and momentum is maintained by filling in the details as comfort levels increase through exposure (and personal interest).\n\nThanks!","media":null,"ups":2,"retrieved_on":1441557840,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":8,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t3_24chth","id":"24chth","archived":true,"from":null,"author":"teamnano","is_self":true,"from_id":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/24chth/scientists_and_engineers_with_little_ml/","secure_media":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","from_kind":null,"created":1398840485,"stickied":false,"score":2,"edited":false,"quarantine":false}
