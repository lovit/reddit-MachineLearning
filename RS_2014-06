Then a simple max on the merit values returned across all the GPUs/features ( vector 1 element per feature as returned by a GPU) does the trick.

{"retrieved_on":1441324545,"ups":7,"media":null,"selftext":"Hey all. I'm currently working on a ML project that involves record linkage optimized by ML. When I first started the project, I knew I would need a way to rapidly evaluate the accuracy of the classifier. I knew I would need a labeled data set, but unfortunately this data set did not exist yet. \n\nI'm not afraid of getting dirty with the data, so I dug in, and eventually found a way to consistently find the correct answer. Unfortunately, labeling this data takes quite a bit of time, since it involves a level of manual record linkage. Hence, I was only able to do a small set on my own. I trained on this data, and found it to generalize fairly well, so a plan was set in place to get a set of outsourced interns to do this labeling task so I could improve performance and generalization.\n\nUnfortunately, I found early on, no one else had the accuracy or efficiency to do this task well. Even when the task was simplified to simply evaluating the accuracy of the output of the classifier, they struggle. They consistently can not see the patterns in the data and mark correct things as incorrect. When I go through their work, and make corrections, they agree that my corrections are accurate, however, they have never improved on the tasks provided to them. \n\nThis is stressing me the hell out. They are the biggest source of error in my project, but I have no other resources to hire someone better. What can I do? The classifier is doing a hell of a job based on my evaluations, but I simply do not have the time to take a sample each time and evaluate it myself. I can't run the optimization system until I have at least a modestly sized set of data with the correct answers. But the team hired to evaluate has a 10% error rate\n\nHave any of you dealt with this issue before?

It's a blank slate, the dynamics of the system are all encoded into genes (as the weights of a standard feedforward neural network, which updates some memory variables as well as the neuron output). It is then evolved to produce the most reward-seeking network. I plan to start on simple tests such as XOR, pole balancing, and mountain car.\n\nThe standard feed-foward neural networks are universal function approximators, so theoretically they can produce any neural network within the limitations of the data the neural networks operate on (their memory variables, their allowed connectivity).\n\nRight now I have planned to evolve the synaptic update, the activation function (it might end up being spiking, it might not), the connector (decides when neurons to connect/disconnect), an input encoder (takes a single float as input and feeds it to the net) and a decoder (reverse of encoder).\n\nHas anybody ever thought of this before? Surely someone has, but I can't find anything on the web.\nJust wanted to share this. If someone makes something out of this, at least I feel like I contributed somehow. I will let you all know how it goes. Also, ideas on how to improve the system are welcome.\n\nEDIT: It seems that many people confuse this approach with something like [NEAT](http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~kstanley/neat.html)\n\nHowever, instead of deciding the weights of the neural network, the evolutionary algorithm instead decides what the rules for updating/maintaining the network are. Also, this would not be a feedforward neural network necessarily, it could end up being one, but it can really represent any topology of some sort of nodes that might be evolved to work like neural networks (it may not actually use logic as we understand neural networks using today, since the purpose is to evolve that).","media":null,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","hide_score":false,"created_utc":"1402017316","author_flair_text":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"MachineLearning","title":"A Simple Idea (cross-post from /r/artificial)","secure_media_embed":{},"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","distinguished":null,"stickied":false,"from_id":null,"secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/27flyw/a_simple_idea_crosspost_from_rartificial/","created":1402020916,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","from_kind":null,"score":1,"edited":1402167324,"quarantine":false,"gilded":0,"name":"t3_27flyw","link_flair_css_class":null,"archived":true,"id":"27flyw","author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":11,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"is_self":true,"from":null,"author":"CireNeikual"}

There was a lot of skepticism but also encouragement, thank you for both!\n\nI have brought my meta-learning algorithm into a working state. It is still far from done, but its first results show that it is possible to make this concept work. I call it \"HyperNet\", since it is essentially optimizing only hyperparameters (functions, in this case).\n\nThe first experiment I ran it on was XOR. It first kept on getting stuck in a local minimum where it would just output the same value for every input, but after some bug fixes and tweaks I got it out of there. I just now (5 minutes before writing this) got it to ascend into the next local minimum, where all but one of the outputs are correct. This was after only 100 generations, and it was still steadily improving before I stopped it (it was taking quite a while ;) ). I will dedicate more time to the evolution of proper learning rules after submitting this post.\n\nI just had to post about this, it's so exciting!\n\nI will upload the code when it is ready (when it is less buggy).","retrieved_on":1441315967,"ups":0,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/27wn27/metalearning_algorithm_hypernet_produces_first/","link_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"Meta-Learning Algorithm \"HyperNet\" produces first results!","subreddit":"MachineLearning","media_embed":{},"author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1402518629","hide_score":false,"domain":"self.MachineLearning"}

Essentially they are a neural network with a single layer of many hidden nodes.  However, the weights connecting the inputs to the hidden nodes are assigned randomly and never updated.  The weights between the hidden nodes and the outputs are learned in a single step. \n\nFrom my read, the method is not new.  [There is another post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/z09ag/physicists_you_win_the_state_of_the_art_in/) that claims it is similar to Random Matrices of Eugene Wigner in the 1940s, or gaussian processes from the 90s or Random Kitchen Sinks.\n\nI started playing with [a python implementation of ELM](https://github.com/dclambert/Python-ELM), and it is crazy fast and works quite well.  Seems not to overfit on cross validation, and is pretty insensitive to the number of hidden nodes beyond a certain point.  Works on simple linear relationships, and more complex nonlinear ones quite well.  Handles noise well.  Also it is just so darn simple.   \n\nSo what is the catch?  Are these widely used?
