Getting the data was the easy part for me, this ML business is tricky stuff.\n\nDoes anyone know of an even simpler way to get into all of this? \n\nMy current knowledge is of regression (I have practiced simple linear regression, and a little bit of polynomial regression, and I have only read about multilinear regression) and just a tad bit of K-means through my reading of ISL. \n\nCan someone here tell me about how they \"got good\" at ML? Am I just struggling or is this normal? My reading has finally reached the beginning of classification but I don't feel like I have everything quite understood yet because I haven't practiced enough. Should I try and continue to read a bit, practice a bit and slowly grind my way through or did you find that reading a lot and then practicing a lot was a better method? i.e. do the reading first, then the practice instead of trying both simultaneously. \n\nFor programming, it was easier and more interesting to learn by doing instead of by reading. I can understand the math but like any other math book, it's slow and can get rather boring quickly. I suppose I just want to develop \"ML maturity\" if that's a term, analogical to \"mathematical maturity.\"\n\nThe good thing is that I have noticed some progress already, but ONLY through practicing with code. Reading the book alone doesn't give me nearly as well of an understanding of the material, even if the graphs and resulting code is presented in front of me. I can read the code and understand it, but it's not quite the same as being able to do it from scratch on my own when I see fit.","media":null}

You compare the distance between your two vector of parameters, and if this distance is small, you stop, if not, you update your vector of parameters (that you obtained for the simulated data) and use the updated value to re-simulate data. You then re-estimate the simple model on this new simulated data set and compare the distance to the vector of parameters obtained with the simple regression on the real data again and so on.\n\nWhat I'd like to do, is randomly draw 1000 (or more) candidate vectors and compute the distance. Then, only select the 5% of vectors with the smallest distance and then use these vectors to breed a new generation of vectors. This would be the update step. Using these new vectors, I'd simulate data, compare the distances, select yet again 5% etc. \n\nNow my question: I know very little about GAs, but to create a new generation, wouldn't it suffice to simply draw vectors from say, a multivariate normal distribution, with mu equal to the mean of my 5% best vectors and a good choice for the variance-covariance matrix? The drawn vectors would inherit characteristics from their parents in that way, and since it's random, the mutation step would be taken care of also. The problem I see is if my 5% best candidates are actually very bad and I'd get stuck with a shitty population that only have shitty kids.\n\nDoes this make sense? And if not, I'd really appreciate some literature on GA when the parameters are real valued. I found this paper that may be what I'm looking for: http://www.complex-systems.com/abstracts/v09_i06_a01.html but I'd like to know if my idea could work and if not, why. \n\nThanks a lot!","media":null,"ups":2,"retrieved_on":1440987003,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/2r8ciw/question_about_crossover_in_genetic_algorithm/","from":null,"author":"gumbel_distro","is_self":true,"num_comments":12,"author_flair_css_class":null,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t3_2r8ciw","archived":true,"id":"2r8ciw","score":2,"edited":1420325873,"quarantine":false,"from_id":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/2r8ciw/question_about_crossover_in_genetic_algorithm/","secure_media":null,"created":1420316538,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","from_kind":null,"stickied":false}

{"ups":0,"retrieved_on":1440985198,"selftext":"This is going to be very \"basic\" for most of you, but I haven't yet taken a formal course on Machine Learning or worked on ML in any way - so this is pretty special for me. I have a pretty extensive background in mathematics and programming, but never had a chance to learn ML. I currently have a few weeks free which I will be using to learn ML. \n\nSo anyway, [In this lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzxYlbK2c7E) - which I'm yet to finish - Andrew Ng mentions one of the pioneers of ML (or, after a bit of googling, AI), Arthur Samuel, and how he wrote a program that \"learns\" to play checkers. So I thought, why not start there - and wrote a bit of code that learns to play tic-tac-toe.\n\nI have kept the code [here](http://codetidy.com/5973/). Pretty basic stuff - a class that implements the game of tic-tac-toe, and keep a \"probability array\" of possible next \"plays\" all initialized at 1. Then if a particular play begets a win, the weight of that play will be incremented by 1, hence making it more likely to be played. Similarly, it increments a play by 1/2 if it ends in a draw.\n\nIt is trained by choosing a random next play, based on it's weight in the probability array, and not uniformly over the array - so we can explore further down the tree. \n\nHere's the output of a comp v comp game, where the computer chooses the best strategy, after training the code for 1000 games:\n\n    0 | 0 | 0\n    0 | 0 | 0\n    0 | 0 | 0\n    \n    0 | 0 | 0\n    0 | 0 | 0\n    0 | 0 | 1\n    \n    0 | 0 | 0\n    0 | 2 | 0\n    0 | 0 | 1\n        \n    0 | 0 | 0\n    0 | 2 | 1\n    0 | 0 | 1\n    \n    0 | 0 | 2\n    0 | 2 | 1\n    0 | 0 | 1\n    \n    0 | 0 | 2\n    0 | 2 | 1\n    0 | 1 | 1\n    \n    0 | 0 | 2\n    0 | 2 | 1\n    2 | 1 | 1\n\n\nAnd this is what happens when two veterans (100 * 3^9 games) play the game:\n    \n    0 | 0 | 0\n    0 | 0 | 0\n    0 | 0 | 0\n    \n    0 | 0 | 0\n    0 | 1 | 0\n    0 | 0 | 0\n    \n    2 | 0 | 0\n    0 | 1 | 0\n    0 | 0 | 0\n    \n    2 | 0 | 1\n    0 | 1 | 0\n    0 | 0 | 0\n    \n    2 | 0 | 1\n    0 | 1 | 0\n    2 | 0 | 0\n    \n    2 | 0 | 1\n    1 | 1 | 0\n    2 | 0 | 0\n    \n    2 | 0 | 1\n    1 | 1 | 2\n    2 | 0 | 0\n    \n    2 | 0 | 1\n    1 | 1 | 2\n    2 | 1 | 0\n    \n    2 | 2 | 1\n    1 | 1 | 2\n    2 | 1 | 0\n    \n    2 | 2 | 1\n    1 | 1 | 2\n    2 | 1 | 1\n\nAnd this is what happens when Player 1 plays the second best strategy and Player 2 plays the best strategy. \n\n    0 | 0 | 0\n    0 | 0 | 0\n    0 | 0 | 0\n    \n    0 | 0 | 0\n    1 | 0 | 0\n    0 | 0 | 0\n    \n    0 | 0 | 0\n    1 | 2 | 0\n    0 | 0 | 0\n    \n    0 | 0 | 0\n    1 | 2 | 0\n    0 | 1 | 0\n    \n    0 | 0 | 0\n    1 | 2 | 0\n    2 | 1 | 0\n    \n    0 | 0 | 0\n    1 | 2 | 1\n    2 | 1 | 0\n    \n    0 | 0 | 2\n    1 | 2 | 1\n    2 | 1 | 0\n    \nI will be following the above lecture series for the rest of the way - and will also look to you guys for guidance.

I'm looking for something that concentrates on everyday things like pencils, matches, rulers, cupboards, cats, dogs etc.\n\nI realize that a comprehensive database would be prohibitively large, but I've struggled to find anything at all. Very grateful for any help!\n\n**EDIT**\n\nThank you for the great replies so far. I will respond to each individually, but from the replies, it is clear that it would be useful if I said more about what I'm trying to do, and it seems like a better idea to put the information up here once, rather than spread across several responses.\n\nBasically, I am fascinated by the human ability to master novel subject areas: a human can go from a child knowing nothing (or at least possessing only certain innate knowledge) to understanding biotechnology, or banking or law enforcement. This ability, combined with the biological fact that the brain is a collection of neurons, each fairly simple in itself, is clear evidence that it is possible for a computer (provided we define computer broadly enough to include brains) to master novel concepts and subjects.\n\nI am trying to replicate human intelligence on a silicon-based computer, and given the above, I believe that it should be possible. The approach I am taking is this. I believe there must be a set of concepts and processes that form a kind of 'base' set, upon which more complex knowledge and processes are built. I don't see how it can be otherwise. A child cannot be born knowing nothing at all, but also cannot be born knowing about biotechnology. Therefore the complex concepts of the modern world must be constructible using the base set that a child is born with, or at least develops innately. If we can identify that base set, and the algorithms human brains use to build more complex concepts, it should be possible to replicate that base set and algorithms on a silicon computer.\n\nThe first hurdle I see is getting a base set of structured information into a computer. A child might see a black cat, and when an adult points at it and says \"cat\", the child can guess heuristically that the adult is telling the child that 'cat' is the name for that object. When the adult points at lots of black objects, and says 'black', the child can guess that the adult is giving it the name for the color that all those objects have. However, it's hard for a silicon computer to get going. How can it know what 'cat' or 'black' mean? However, I believe the problem is surmountable, by identifying a base set of concepts that interlock, so that even though the computer may have no eyes with which to identify cats in the outside world, it has a concept cat, knows that it is in the class of animals, that it has the color black, and so on. It can also know, from a dictionary, how to build more complex concepts from the simple ones it knows about. Similarly, I think that if a young child became blind after a small amount of experience of the world, it could still develop concepts of more complex things simply by explanations by people in terms that it already understood.\n\nSo a long answer, but that's what I'm trying to do.\n\n\n**EDIT 2**\n\n/u/squirreltalk asked:\n&gt; I think I still need more clarification on what your goal is. Is it scientific -- are you attempting to model human knowledge and use thereof? Or technological -- do you want a system that is useful, if not psychologically plausible?\n\nWell, both actually. The human approach to understanding, predicting and controlling our environment is clearly very powerful and works. Perhaps I'm naive, but I have the view that anything the brain can do, a silicon computer can too (forgetting consciousness, which I think is a red-herring, and most likely to be an implementation detail). I am therefore taking the view that by modelling closely the way that humans learn and develop new concepts, we can develop a useful technology that can do the same thing.\n\nI would love to see a computer being asked \"How can I make money?\" and it automatically goes on google to find out, does some searches, comes up with some answers, and not because it has been programmed to do this, but because it has come to understand what money is and what making money means. If a person can do this, what are the barriers preventing a computer from doing it? I'm sure that a child of 5 who was cut off from perceiving the world, but could still receive linguistic communications (eg could still hear speech), would be able to develop useful knowledge of the world in areas it had no prior knowledge of. Surely, then, the same must be true of a computer. If a computer can be given the concepts that a 5-year-old has, the computer must surely be able to derive the concepts that a 25-year-old has, given appropriate linguistic input, if it uses the same mechanisms that a human uses to develop from a 5-year-old into a 25-year-old?","id":"2rcm3k","archived":true,"gilded":0,"name":"t3_2rcm3k","link_flair_css_class":null,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":12,"is_self":true,"author":"like_the_boss","from":null,"stickied":false,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/2rcm3k/are_there_any_publicly_available_database_of/","secure_media":null,"created":1420418160,"from_kind":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","from_id":null,"quarantine":false,"edited":1420429679,"score":9}

I'd rather specialize in one specific skill (data mining) and apply it than to try to master many skills.

The original alexnet was designed for two GPUs so I was considering overfeat or oxfordnet but the former does not seem to specify what kind of machines they trained on or training time (and the latter is a bit intimidating).  Can anyone recommend the best architecture to use for given my setup.  I'm not expecting to match state of the art systems but something alex-net quality would be nice.  Also, if imagenet is a hassle to get a hold of (the URLs are freely available but it would mean downloading 1m images) is there an alternative beefy dataset?  I also wouldn't mind trying something a bit simpler before doing for the gold and glory of imagenet (but I've already played with cifar-10 and cifar-100 doesn't seem much more interesting).\n\nAs a final follow up I have considered just downloading oxfordnet and porting it (i.e. the net specification) to my code but its in caffe format and I haven't been able to find the documentation explaining that format.\n","media":null,"ups":3,"retrieved_on":1440979355,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":20,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t3_2rocqc","id":"2rocqc","archived":true,"from":null,"author":"spurious_recollectio","is_self":true,"from_id":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","from_kind":null,"created":1420669304,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/2rocqc/help_getting_started_with_imagenet/","secure_media":null,"stickied":false,"score":3,"edited":false,"quarantine":false}

Up until now, I've mostly been using Machine Learning classifiers as black boxes for NLP tasks, but for my senior thesis, I'd like to work on something a bit more ML-based.\n\nMy current interest is that I'd like to learn about neural nets. Last semester, I had to give a presentation about Mikolov's \"Distributed Representations of Words and Their Compositionalities.\" http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5021-distributed-representations-of-words-and-phrases-and-their-compositionality.pdf . I did my best on the paper, and the results were interesting enough but the methods were obviously over my head. I mention this just because it's my current goal of something I'd really like to be able to understand (as well as anyone else does, I suppose) over the next few months.\n\nIn the past few weeks, I've gone through Ng's Coursera course for Machine Learning and I feel pretty comfortable with the basics of ML concepts. I've also investigated some other resources for trying to better understand Neural Nets. I found Nielsen's work-in-progress book VERY helpful http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/. The biggest breakthrough/realization that I had was when I realized that backpropogation is just a Dynamic Programming algorithm that memoizes partial derivatives (and I can't believe none of these resources just said that upfront).\n\nI've also tried Geoffrey Hinton's Coursera course and Hugo Larochelle's youtube videos, but I personally didn't find those as helpful. I got about halfway through Hinton's course and maybe 10 videos into Larochelle's.\n\nIf you're still reading by now, thanks! Does anyone have any suggestions on where to look next in order to better understand how to build a neural net that can learn a distributed representation for a language model? I'm quite comfortable with simple n-gram models with smoothing, but any time I find a paper from a google search involving \"neural network\" and \"language model\", all of the papers I find are still over my head. Are there any easy-to-understand NN models that I can start with, or do I need to jump into knowing how Recurrent NNs work (which I currently don't really understand)? I'd love to read any relevant papers, but I just can't figure out where to begin so that I can understand what's going on.","retrieved_on":1440969671,"ups":23,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/2s8za4/neural_network_language_models/","link_flair_text":null}

{"selftext":"I'm working on a ANN, and got it working on simple AND/XOR problems using gradient descent, but I am finding it much more difficult to find the optimal weights for more complex problems. My solution was to use Scipy's minimum function instead, but I am having some trouble.\n\nMy ANN is a class, and when ANN object is created, weights are created upon initialization as the data member self.__weights, this is useful because I don't actually have to pass a weights parameter into any of the methods used on the class, and it worked in my earlier non-Scipy using implementation.\n\nI use the self.__weights as the initial guess for the minimum function, and pass in the other arguments(input data, the correct output values) needed to make the function work. But it seems, that the optimizer keeps passing the weights into the methods(Cost Function/FeedForward/Backprop) as a parameter when there is no need to since it can be called with self.__weights. For instance, when my FeedForward method is called, it passes in the weights, and states that the input isn't of the correct size, this is because the weights were passed in instead. And the input data is passed into the minimum's optional 'arg=' parameter.\n\nSo, all explanation done, must the value to be optimized actually be a parameter of the methods being used to optimized it, and not just a class data member that can be called from anywhere within in the class? I've tried to find examples using a class they pass in there 'weights' or other value to be optimized depending on there use, not a data member of the class.\n\n\n\nThis is code a snippet is located in my train method. It's parameters are input_data and target.\n\n    opt_theta = minimize(self.CostFunction,x0=self.__weights,args = (input_data,target),method='Newton-CG',jac=   self.Weight_Grad)       \n    print(opt_theta)\n    self.__weights = opt_theta.x \n\nself.CostFunction and self.Weight_Grad both take those same two parameters. Both of these latter two functions use a Feedforward method to get the output of the network, and do there respective task with that info. Whenever I call the minimize function it seems it passes self.__weights into self.CostFunction as the input_data parameter, which then gets passed into the FeedForward method as input and I get an error. IF i print the \"input\" passed into Feedforward it is the value of self.__weights. This is how I know self.__weights is getting passed in as a parameter when it shouldn't.\n\nSo, I thought I would create a \"dummy\"? parameter to pass the the self.weights value into for all of the methods('self.CostFunction,'self.Weight_Grad,Feedforward) and an error did not occur but there was no change in the weights or the output.

Also, I'm lacking Abu-Mostafa's book \"Learning from Data\"- for those familiar, how much am I missing?\n\nAuxiliary Courses:\n\n* [MIT's The Analytics Edge hosted through edX](https://www.edx.org/course/analytics-edge-mitx-15-071x-0#.VLnDdCvF9ZA)\n* [Udacity's Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud120)\n\nNote: I'm alread a quarter way through the Udacity course. It's basically a walkthrough tutorial for python's sklearn. For future student's, I'd recommend taking it in conjuction with Andrew Ng's Coursera machine learning course.\n\nSo now to my questions for you guys! Any feedback is greatly appreciated, but I have a few specific questions in mind.\n\n1. How much material overlaps between the courses? My understanding is at least PGM is apart from the rest.\n1. Am I taking these in the right order?\n1. Are there any courses that I should add to my curriculum?\n1. Are there any books that I should add?\n1. Any other advice for me before I embark on this journey?\n\nFinally, if anyone is interested in being a study partner send me a PM!\n\nThank you!!!","media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/2sp1nx/looking_for_feedback_on_my_machine_learning/","is_self":true,"from":null,"author":"EngineeredEdge","gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t3_2sp1nx","archived":true,"id":"2sp1nx","author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":13,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"score":8,"edited":false,"quarantine":false,"stickied":false,"from_id":null,"created":1421460866,"from_kind":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/2sp1nx/looking_for_feedback_on_my_machine_learning/"}

But I don't intend on staying like this; I want to go deeper into the field and I need your advice on some of the best beginner - intermediate books on ML and AI. Whatever books that you have come across that you feel will help me at this point or later, that may have helped you as well. Preferably free material or ones that are affordably priced (e.g. below or between $50 - $100). But if you feel that there are some that may not fall into that range but are extremely useful books with great content, please enlighten me. I will be looking into enrolling in online courses at sites like Udacity, Coursera and Standford. But of course books are the best learning material. I am extremely appreciative for absolutely any help you provide. Thank you so much in advance!","media":null,"ups":0,"retrieved_on":1440957993}

Beside this limitation, I am free to do pretty much anything I want \u2013 this can be either some very abstract math research, or just a smart program, or even both. I decided to go with something related to ML (maybe computer vision or image processing), because these fields always attracted me \u2013 seems like some kind of magic.\n\nAs soon as I had made this decision, I faced two problems. First one is lack of knowledge. In the university we have a lot of math, but almost nothing related to computer science. That's why I am currently taking some ML-related courses on Coursera, and also that's how I found Reddit \u2013 it seems to be very useful source of information.\n\nThe second problem is a good topic for a project, and that's why I need your help. I don't want to spend my time doing something that is already done; I would really like to try and make something new. Something useful, something related to the fields listed above. Do you have an idea of any interesting problem that are not solved yet?

This way I only have one predictor (Team1_Score, for example) and for each game I have two lines of data, one where the original Team1_Score was being predicted, and then the flipped/reversed line of data where Team1 and Team2 swap places. \n\nDoes this make sense, or has anyone done this? I think it may depend on the algorithm used as to how well it works out (the initial plan is SVM), but I'm just curious. I've just about got the data I need in one place, so I planned on trying it out anyways, but thought I'd check in here first and see what the general feeling was around doing this.\n\n","media":null}

One thing I've noticed is that the majority of articles here and elsewhere in describing techniques (especially neural networks) are about classifying images. \n\nIn Andrew Ng's Coursera course, in describing situations where a huge amount of data might boost accuracy, he divides machine learning problems into two categories with the question: would a human be able to readily understand the answer from the data? To broaden my point, it seems like most the articles I read are about situations where it's very easy for a human to give the answer for the data, but the problem is getting a computer to automate it. \n\nMy question today is: I'm interested in problems that are not readily answerable for a human looking at the data: namely predicting human behavior (choices) from data about their previous choices. Are there any resources more tailored to that problem domain? Are there approaches that work better in situations like that? I know state of the art accuracy for image classification is 6 percent error rate. What's state of the art accuracy for whether someone will buy something, how they'll vote, etc? Are there algorithms better suited to \"complex\" problems? \n\nThanks for any insight you can provide!

I am currently in the process of finding a new career and am in need of some advice. A little bit about myself: about 6 month ago I graduated with a PhD in applied math doing research in Ocean acoustic. Upon graduation I immediately found a job doing ocean acoustic research in a government lab. As a PhD student, I was already tired of my graduate research, and this job just proved that I did not enjoy the field of ocean acoustic research. I became interested in the field of machine learning and would like to make a career transition. \n\nI would say my programming ability is equivalent someone with a bachelor in CS but no industrial experience. I used mostly Matlab for my research. I learned some basic c++, python, java in my spare time, and used swift to write 2 apps on the apple app store. I learned some theory about Genetic algorithm, feed forward neural network, and some unsupervised learning technique such as self-organizing map, Isotop, t-sne.  My ideal job would be a research position in companies such as google or facebook, or companies that uses machine learning method for financial applications/other interesting applications. \n\nMy question to you is the following: In your opinion, \n\n1. what skills do you think I\u2019m lacking, and in what order should I focus my time on acquiring them? \n\n2. If you were a recruiter, how would you view someone who came from the field of applied mathematics? \n\n3. Do you have any advice for me in my new job search? Any comment would be appreciated.\n\nThanks.\n\n\nEdit: Thanks guy I have to say now I'm convinced this is a very hot field. Just a day after this post I already got several request for CVs.

I can think of two options for handling this:\n\n1. Represent each input word as a V-dimensional vector (V being the vocabulary size), full of zeros, with a 1 in the correct position, and multiply this with the matrix of word vectors. This will get the correct vector from the matrix. The GPU is optimized for matrix multiplications, but because the word vector matrix is 100000x200, it is still a massive multiplication for just one word.\n\n2.

I was *so* sure that it was one of my friends just yanking my chain with a 10$ domain purchase and a fake email account, that my initial reply was very sterile, and only questioned where the referral came from, then why they were reaching out to me.\n\n*For a little more background, I have a high school diploma and about a decade of work experience - I don't write papers or books, I don't do conferences, I don't blog - I don't even have facebook or twitter. If it wasn't for this reddit account to share development about a side game project, I pretty much wouldn't even exist on the internet other than by word of mouth.*\n\nAfter a couple more emails they sent me an account for their publishing website with elevated credentials to read some of their other books for free (obviously seems legit at this point), and asked to set up a call. Finally I get someone on the phone and eventually find out: \"we have someone on staff who does nothing but find interesting people to write books, so congratulations you are interesting!\". Some used car salesmanship and invasive questions later - and someone apparently found my stack overflow account which led to my email address.\n\nWithin a few more minutes we were talking about a book index, advances, a formal proposal, timelines, contracts and target audiences. Having *never* so much as considered writing a book before, I was very much in the dark to all the numbers and standard practices involved. We scheduled a second call after I had some time to do a lot of googling.\n\n**Tech book authors make on average between $1000-$25000 depending on a lot of factors - which is paid out over one year to three years, equating to virtually slave labour wages. So you probably wouldn't want to write a book for the money. In a nutshell it's an ongoing battle for tech publishers to find someone to write high quality books for them, for what is basically no pay. Books apparently make a great business card: \"oh yeah I wrote the book on it!\", but with no shortage of work, and no surplus of time I politely turned the offer down.**\n\nI've never actually heard of my particular situation happening before - but then I'm not at all active in the community, so then who could I have heard it from? \n\n**So /r/MachineLearning... has this ever happened to anyone else, and what did you do?** I'm still not entirely sure what to make of it all, other than being pretty flattered - and getting into some pretty interesting conversations with a publisher.","media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/2tu980/i_just_turned_down_a_book_offer_to_write_adaptive/"}

I used Feedforward neural network and now I can see it isnt exactly right choice for this kind of application (creatures have no memory, etc.)\n\nI would like to try again, start from scratch, and I would like to perform better than before. However, I dont know what neural network architecture to select.\n\nThe task for is to surive. I dont have any objective aside than observing interesting patterns of behaviour that can evolve. Basically I would like to \"seed\" the world with some properties with creatures that can exploit those (food, temperature, danger) and such. Everything very basically modeled, in flat 2D.\n\nWhat I need (each part is actually question):\n\n* Possibility of memory: Should I study more about memory cells, or is using correct NN architecture (like Reccurent NN) enough? What will be main differencies?\n* Possibility of mutations: I would like to not only mutate weihts in network, but also possibility of adding weights / neurons into \"black box\". I plan to use genetic algorithm, so cross mutations + random mutations.\n* Easy programming: I plan on not using any assets and to write my NN from ground in order to learn. I would preffer more easy neural networks than others. (While Im writing this, I realize there might not be difference)\n\n\n\nWhat I dont need:\n\n* Quick computation: I think that 90% of CPU time will be used on other things of controling my creatures, than on computing NN. (as I am terrible programmer)\n* Training: I will use genetic algorithm to train, so I dont need typical training methods to train NN. I can use types of NN where training part is very CPU intense, as I will drop this part out.\n\n\n\n\nI am looking at possible types of NN and I think some type of Recurrent network would be suitable, but cant really pick a winner, since I only ever worked with Feedforward type, and I will need to learn about the type you will reccomend before I start writing it. I would like to learn just the one you will suggest instead of learn pros/cons of all, since I think It would set me back for too long.\n\n\nQuestion is: What is the type of NN that you think would suit this best?"}

It is how cells sense and respond to cues from the environment, for example a microbial cell detecting and moving toward a food source, or one of your cells sensing injury and inflaming itself.  In these networks, nodes are intracellular proteins and edges are biochemical interactions between them.  The input is a extracellular cue (eg. a hormone or growth factor) and the response is a cellular decision (eg. proliferate/do nothing), which often means some gene in the DNA is activated. \n\nIn ANNs, we tend to work with generic network topologies, such as multilayer perceptrons.  We do not use the actual topologies evolved in the brain, nor use the evolved dynamics of signal processing in the brain to inform the selection of weights and activation functions -- at least I have not heard of this.  \n\nI suspect because it is probably damn hard to map out the circuits of the brain in this fashion.  But with current bioinformatics technology, it is not so hard to map out the signaling networks in a cell.  \n\nWhat do people here think about mimicking these topologies and network dynamics in designing ANNs?  My intuition: such topologies could be useful when signals are coming from a noisy environment and it is important to accurately detect certain events that occur rarely --eg. harmful network activity, terrorist activity.  \n\nEdit: I have heard of some biomimetic approaches before, for example with [intrusion detection systems modeled after the human immune system](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11047-006-9026-4#page-1).  However, though these models look at immune cells, from what I saw they never specifically modeled the signaling network topology of these cells in a network-based classifier.

Since missiles can hit you in a matter of seconds, it's not really fast enough for a human to react and engage that one target, let alone the salvo you will be getting from the air, land, sea etc. all at the same time. Programs are written to detect the targets, assess the targets, and engage the targets based on which are the most dangerous.\n\nTechnology and artificial intelligence will continue to improve and one can expect that the military will always get the best stuff first.\nWhile in the civilian sector there may be movements to limit the power of artificial intelligence in order that we don't lose control to something so powerful we cannot comprehend it, and I can even see that spilling into the military sector, the main problem will be the next big war.\n\nThe nature of war dictates certain selection pressures on different systems and to different degrees than in peacetime. In the next war, the faction with the best AIs will likely win. The reason is that the side with the best AI will be able to out think and out react and out maneuver everyone else. At that point, all the factions that tried to limit AI power during peacetime will be moot because those factions will likely not survive.\n\nI believe it is through this, that AI will push through the ceiling that humans will try to impose and from that point on, we will be at the mercy of something we cannot possibly hope to understand or catch up to.\n\nThis does not necessarily mean that we will be destroyed. It will mean that we will essentially lose control and are at the mercy of the AI.\n\nThe only way I can see around this right now is if we augment human intelligence so that it is competitive with artificial intelligence. What I mean is some sort of neural chip or something that will significantly enhance our mental abilities. If we cannot out compete artificial intelligence, which will move forward due to our laziness (in peacetime), and our military requirements in times of war, we are fucked.","retrieved_on":1440936986,"ups":0}

I'm new at this stuff and have been reading Learning with Kernels to get up to speed.  In the meantime I've been working with some classification problems that have arisen in my work, which, not coincidentally, was the motivation for me to get into SVM.  I've worked with Bayesian methods for classification before, and I say this in case you notice me drawing from that in any erroneous way. \n\nSo, I have a bunch of variables associated with two states of a system.  We know for theoretical reasons related to the underlying problem that interactions amongst these variables are important in terms of predicting these states. I'm trying to use SVM with these variables and their respective 2-way interactions to see if I can predict the states on a set of training data as well as on some test data.  \n\nAnyway, I found that when I use all the variables and their respective interactions, I can only get about 60% accuracy on my test data.  When I look at the variables and their interactions, I see that some VERY obviously follow the two states I'm trying to predict.  When I get rid of the other variables/interactions, then try to fit the model, I can get above 90% accuracy on the test data.  \n\nSo, this is awesome! But, it doesn't feel kosher.  \n\nAnyway, because I'm very new at this I was hoping that someone could maybe talk a little bit about why the non-informative variables carry enough weight in the model to hamper the fit and if there are any techniques I can do to condition my variables/interactions before fitting a model in the future.  \n\nThat's all -- thanks in advance! \n\n","domain":"self.MachineLearning","hide_score":false,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"MachineLearning","created_utc":"1422598864","author_flair_text":null,"title":"Question from a beginner regarding features and SVM","secure_media_embed":{},"distinguished":null,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","stickied":false,"secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/2u68d6/question_from_a_beginner_regarding_features_and/","from_kind":null,"created":1422598864,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","from_id":null,"quarantine":false,"edited":false,"score":5,"id":"2u68d6","archived":true,"gilded":0,"name":"t3_2u68d6","link_flair_css_class":null,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":8,"is_self":true,"author":"neurone214","from":null}
