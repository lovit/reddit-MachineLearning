Sam Harris was arguing for Consequentialism while the two hosts took the side of Deontology. I was struck by the amount of time the two sides where arguing about the same thing without realizing it. \n\nThat's when I came up with the idea of creating a computer algorithm that untangles or keeps the 'flow' of philosophical debates by eliminating argumentative fallacies along the way. Keep in mind that the goal of said algorithm would not be to 'solve' the debate(if there's such a thing as solving a philosophical debate) by to keep the debating parties on a 'straight' path. \n\nThe idea of a 'straight' path in a philosophical debate presupposes, in the case of the podcast, that there is an evident and distinct definition of \"Consequentialism\" which is separate from that of \"Deontology\". So there should be a way of building an algorithm on these definitions and 'feed' these to a machine which in turn will keep tabs of when the debate is steering off course.\n\n\n\n","retrieved_on":1440879348,"ups":0,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"MachineLearning","created_utc":"1425211493","author_flair_text":null,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","hide_score":false,"distinguished":null,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"default","title":"Can we create a computer algorithm that untangles philosophical debates?","secure_media_embed":{},"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/2xjzou/can_we_create_a_computer_algorithm_that_untangles/","secure_media":null,"created":1425211493,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","from_kind":null,"from_id":null,"stickied":false,"quarantine":false,"edited":1425220270,"score":0,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"num_comments":5,"author_flair_css_class":null,"id":"2xjzou","archived":true,"link_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"name":"t3_2xjzou","author":"[deleted]","from":null,"is_self":true}

Examples of ways I intend to interpret the data include:\n\n\u2022\tare respondents in support of the first view of the topic, or the other (binary classification/logistic regression)\n\n\u2022\tcan the respondents opinions and meta attributes be clustered to reveal these two view points (dual centroid k-means) \n\n\u2022\tand I don\u2019t know what else at the moment, but certainly other things as I develop the idea more fully\n\nI guess my real question is, what types of questions should I ask and in what order so that I don\u2019t skew the results of the data.\n\nFor instance, let\u2019s say the first question asks them to classify themselves into one of these two groups explicitly, then I\u2019d be worried that they won\u2019t answer other questions as accurately because they\u2019ve been primed to think about them in the context of the first question. Alternatively, I could lead with the less obvious questions, but then they might also answer inaccurately for not understanding the appropriate context. No matter how I think about it, I see the error introduced and I was wondering if you guys have any personal suggestions or best practices for improving the quality of the data.\n\nAt this point, my conceptions about how I should administer this survey are as follows:\n\n**DO** be very descriptive about what the survey is intended to reveal \n\n**DO NOT** ask multiple similar questions to reduce the chance of noise in the data\n\n**DO NOT** ask questions that could be interpreted as threatening (causing a respondent to feel guilty and answer inaccurately)\n\nWhat should I change or add?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThe following is a survey that will provide me with the necessary data to test and apply my knowledge of machine learning concepts and web development as well as add an element to my portfolio of coding projects. This is also for fun!

When the day closes, the contractor emails in their typed version of the notes they made at the proceeding to a data entry pool which separates out the relevant info and enters it into the company's system which stores it to the RDBMS.  The company would like to have a classification system take a 'first pass' at the paragraph text and attempt to classify the information as their appropriate type (e.g. - the followings sentences are disposition information, these sentences are sentencing info, etc...).  A human would still examine and confirm the machine's selections but it would save hundreds of hours per week in transcribing if it was right just some of the time.     \n\nI am fortunate (I guess...) in that I have significant corpus (literally millions or tens of millions of examples).  For a proof of concept, I went through and pulled the last 2.5 million sentences, stripped out the stop words and broke the sentences into uni-grams and bi-grams.  I then did the same with an example email.  I replaced things dates and dollar amounts with some static value (|DOLLARS| or |DATE|) since they are variable and don't really tell me anything. I have around  10000K unique bi-grams after doing all of this from the corpus data.   \n\nThis is where I'm stuck.  Most classification samples I've seen appear to be deciding 'which of two types but it's definitely one of these two...'.  In my sample, something could be one of several different types or none of the types at all.  (EX: The sentence \"The judge awarded the plaintiff attorney fees and default judgment\" has a high likelihood of belonging to one of my classifications whereas the sentence \"I couldn't hear the plaintiff attorney's comments due to a loud heater element\" belongs to nothing. )  What I'm looking for is some way to generate a \"confidence\" number that some sentence is likely some classification.  I don't need to worry about predicting anything from the data, just classification.  I have significant server resources available and things like storage, memory or processors aren't really a concern (meaning if my solution was resource-intensive, they'd spend the money to make it work).  What types of algorithms should I be looking at?  Is there any way to better approach this I'm not seeing?\n\nThanks guys!\n\n\n\n    ","media":null,"hide_score":false,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1425649968","subreddit":"MachineLearning","media_embed":{},"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"Jumping off point: classification problem (I think)","thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"distinguished":null,"stickied":false,"from_id":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","from_kind":null,"created":1425649968,"secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/2y4v31/jumping_off_point_classification_problem_i_think/","edited":false,"score":4,"quarantine":false,"name":"t3_2y4v31","gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"id":"2y4v31","archived":false,"num_comments":5,"author_flair_css_class":null,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"is_self":true,"from":null,"author":"177mph"}

I'm new to ML and data mining, only at the level of Introduction to Statistical Learning so although the algorithms are clearly presented, my data-problem-solving skills are underdeveloped. \n\nSo I have time series data where an event takes place periodically in it. I can somewhat tell with clustering (or just graphing in 3d scatter plots) where in the x,y,z coordinate system this 'event' falls into since this is sensor output... but my problem is that my classifiers/models can only barely get above random predictions. \n\n11 classifiers should be about 9% prediction rate by average right? Mine get about maybe 16% using logistic regression. \n\nI tried taking out some low variance features and it's still the same. I tried using decision trees and random forests but it's worse. I have to predict one of eleven classes, and I have about 7 dimensions of data which can be reduced to 5 or maybe less considering the low variance in some, and I'm guessing my next step is to redo some preprocessing. \n\nMy labels for classes are numeric, 0 - 10 which I think may be contributing some unrelated attribute to the real data, thus I come to mind that I may need to redo the labels perhaps with onehotencoding. This means to make it so that the 0 class would be something like \n\n&lt; 1, 0, 0, 0, .... 0&gt; and the 10 class would be &lt; 0, 0, .... 1&gt; right?\n\nI just wanted to say all of this and ask if I have the right mindset here when it comes to problem solving?

It requires some training of inputs and outputs and then can be used to get expected patterns of outputs from new inputs.\n\nReinforcement learning consists of set states and set action that a machine can take, meaning there are only a limited possible number of \"inputs\" and \"outputs\" so to speak.\n\nSo far, I've be writing a 2048 neural network that has been trained off of me playing some and I want it to play for itself. It works obviously less than ideal. At the moment, the 16 inputs are just fractions of the logs of 2 based on the highest tile (e.g. if the highest tile is 32, 32 would be 1, 16 would be 4/5, 8 would be 3/5, etc and blank would be 0). I got interested in reinforcement learning because it allowed it to plan ahead (which many games or actions in life do) with an expected reward. \n\nEventually, if I would hope to change to RGB values (0-1) instead of my predefined numbers, and the machine could learn on it's own which colors were important. But this seems impossible to do with just limited states and actions.\n\n**My question is, how do I get inputs and outputs with any value (0-1) like a neural network while still keeping a reward system and learning method similar to reinforcement learning?**","media":null,"ups":0,"retrieved_on":1440859305,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/2yqiiw/reinforcement_learning_and_neural_networks/","downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","distinguished":null,"title":"Reinforcement Learning and Neural Networks?","secure_media_embed":{},"created_utc":"1426117394","author_flair_text":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"MachineLearning","domain":"self.MachineLearning","hide_score":false}

When I looked into it a bit more, the weight updates were actually increasing, leading me to think that I was having a problem with exploding gradients.\n\nWhen I applied a cap (0.0001) to to how much I could update eight weight after any pass through an image (I'm doing stochastic gradient descent) things started working a whole lot better, the training error would steadily improve and then hover around a good solution (as opposed to progressively getting worse after finding something decent).   This seemed to be pretty fine with 2 hidden layers and ~2000-4000 random edges.\n\nWhen I bump things up to three hidden layers and ~3000-6000 random edges, stochastic gradient descent just hops around the initial training error, never getting better.  Here I'm assuming the problem is vanishing gradients (which seem to be the issue with &gt; 2 hidden layers).  When I added a minimum cap, basically if the weight update was between -0.0000001 and 0, I set it to -0.0000001, and if it was between 0 and 0.0000001 I set it to 0.0000001, now all of the sudden the 3 layer NNs are training like the 2 layer NNs.\n\nSo I'm wondering A. if there was a bug in my code, that's making me have to cap my weights, and if B. minimum weight updates are a thing for training deeper NNs?","retrieved_on":1440858992,"ups":1,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/2yr6nc/setting_minimum_weight_updates_when_training_nns/","link_flair_text":null,"author":"Vystril","from":null,"is_self":true,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":4,"id":"2yr6nc","archived":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t3_2yr6nc","gilded":0,"quarantine":false,"edited":false,"score":1,"secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/2yr6nc/setting_minimum_weight_updates_when_training_nns/","from_kind":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","created":1426132897,"from_id":null,"stickied":false}

My model will be trained on normal \"legitimate\" system calls and will be tested on intrusive ones.  I have a data set that contains a normal system calls traces and intrusive traces. The traces vary in length and count so the number of traces in each data sets are not equal. Sometime, I have 2000 normal syscalls traces while I have only 2 intrusive syscalls traces. Other times, I have 1001 intrusive syscalls traces and more normal syscalls traces. \n\n**So my question is, how can I do a proper cross validation ? especially in sickit-learn ?** \n\nI know how to do a cross validation for classification problems when your training sets are mixed of both labels. This data set is different. Normal traces are separated from anomalous traces and I don't want to train my model on anomalous traces. So my training set needs to be clean. However, this messes up the whole cross validation. I've thought of many different scenarios. The close one is to do a cross validation on my normal dataset and test the model on the whole intrusive dataset. For example, if I do 3 folds, I will split the normal sets into 3 sets, train my model on 2 of them, combine 3rd dataset with intrusive dataset, and test the model on them. I need to measure the false positive \nrate and true positive rate. Is this approach good ? Isn't testing the on same dataset, which is the intrusive dataset, a bad practice ?\n\nI hope the issue is clear now.

{"media":null,"selftext":"Hi!, I am building an optimization service for an Adtech company. For ranking ads in terms of performance, I am using formula: Log(impressions)*eCPM. Impressions means the number of times ad was served/shown. eCPM = estimated Cost/Revenue per 1000 impressions. The problem with this metric is the cumulative effect of eCPM allows the ad to achieve higher rank after ad has been served for quite a some time. This is because ad had performed well earlier but hasn't been performing now, hence, eCPM remain high inspite for recent drop in performance. I would like to introduce recent trend of ctr or eCPM in the formula. Any recommendations?\n\nOne such recommendation is: Log(impressions)*eCPM*(d(eCPM)/dt) where dt is around 1 hour","retrieved_on":1440849184,"ups":0,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/2zbtsz/machine_learning_in_digital_advertising/","link_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"Machine Learning in Digital Advertising","subreddit":"MachineLearning","media_embed":{},"author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1426576948","hide_score":false,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","quarantine":false,"edited":false,"score":0,"created":1426580548,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","from_kind":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/2zbtsz/machine_learning_in_digital_advertising/","secure_media":null,"from_id":null,"stickied":false,"author":"Arjun_Satya","from":null,"is_self":true,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":0,"id":"2zbtsz","archived":false,"gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t3_2zbtsz"}

He has already made a 3D scanner using Kinnect, but i was wondering if we can use Machine Learning to solve this modeling issue. We can take millions of reading of Limbs (both Right and Left) and them may be Machine can learn from it and given a set of parameter's it can predict the dimensions of other limb. So is this a valid use of machine learning or i am missing something ? Edit1 : I want to measure a lot of normal people with both right and left legs and then based on given input of either of Right or Left leg data, the Machine should be able to predict the other one. Which measurements i will take, i am thinking of like width of leg, lenght of bones, full body height, weight and other such factors.","retrieved_on":1440846998,"ups":0,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":7,"archived":false,"id":"2zgiey","gilded":0,"name":"t3_2zgiey","link_flair_css_class":null,"author":"yantrik","from":null,"is_self":true,"created":1426683202,"from_kind":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/2zgiey/machine_learning_can_it_help_in_this_case/","from_id":null,"stickied":false,"quarantine":false,"score":0,"edited":1426683924}

Most of them are about the same topic but not all are, so I wish to classify the articles by whether they belong to the \"majority topic\" or not. \n\nFor instance, I could have a group of news articles and most are about Obama, but there could be a few articles in there about Italy's economy that mention Obama's name only in passing, and maybe 2-3 other articles are about a car crash and don't mention Obama at all. I want to classify these articles into binary classes of whether they are about Obama or not.\n\nI know there's lots of text/document classification research done, but those are much more complicated than this problem, namely in that they involve multiple classes. This problem only involves binary classes--whether an article is relevant or not, and I'm not trying to find out what the topic is, nor am I testing new points coming in--so I expect a simpler solution exists instead of such advanced methods.\n\nSo far I've determined this is an unsupervised learning problem since I don't know what the \"majority topic\" is in advance. One possible solution is to construct a bag of words vector for each article and do k-means clustering and picking the largest cluster, which ought to work since articles about the same topic ought to share similar vocabulary. However, I don't know if there's a better way to do this and wanted to ask for your opinions. Also, I'd greatly appreciate links to existing code!\n","media":null,"ups":0,"retrieved_on":1440843262}

My school is really pushing cyber security and I'd like to find an area where I can marry my interests in machine learning and neural networks with the kind of research my college would be interested in. I know that there has been some success with anomaly / intrusion detection via neural networks. I was inspired by Chris Domas' TED talk where he describes how he visualizes bytecode to recognize patterns that maybe convnets would be useful at the task of classifying software as malicious or benign. My experience is limited and so I thought that before getting in too deep I'd ask reddit what your thoughts are. I'm thinking that if this approach is technically pheasible that the major hurdle would be in the representation of the code. For example a binary 9 (1001) has only one bit difference to a binary 1 (0001) than the two bit difference to a binary 10 (1010) even though I would likely want the net to consider 9 to be more similar to an 10 than to 1. So a higher level of abstraction would likely be necessary. Do you think this approach is feasible? If so what do you think are the difficulties I have not yet considered?

This paper is specifically about the case where the cross validation (CV) data has some mislabeled samples, but I'm wondering about the case where the cross validation set is labeled perfectly, since it seems you can still overfit. \n\nFor instance, see this [image](http://i.imgur.com/OZA3Vre.png) that depicts only CV data (since training data is irrelevant for this discussion). Line A is the true class separator, but it is not in our hypothesis set. Line B corresponds to a hypothesis with CV error = 1/6 and line C has a CV error of 0. However, B is actually much closer to A than C is, and has a lower (unknowable) \"real\" error.\n\nIn this case picking the hypothesis with the higher CV error would be better, which is similar to the cases in Ng's paper. He describes an algorithm for selecting a better hypothesis than the one with the lowest CV error, but it only works when some samples are mislabeled.

This post is long, so scroll downwards for a tl;dr :)\n\nI posted not too long ago a link to my project titled: [autocomplete](https://github.com/rodricios/autocomplete). What resulted from that post was a correction to my labeling of the project. I initially thought it was a HMM, where in reality it was a Markov chain. \n\nThe thread of conversation that pointed out my mistake can be read [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/2xwi3g/textbooks_dont_explain_the_practicality_of_hidden/cp41osh)\n\nThe thread is too long to post here, but here's a quote from a /u/pretz that detailed some of what was lacking my project: \n\n&gt; [..] You could use the forward algorithm to determine the probability of an entire sequence, but with words in a string [autocomplete] is just a standard markov model, not a hidden markov model (because you know the words, there is no hidden state to estimate for the sequence)\n\n/u/pretz goes on to give a quick synopsis of the HMM he implemented for speech recognition, and then he ends the comment with: \n\n&gt; In your code you see the previous words (your states are your observations), there is no uncertainty about which observations map to which state. Hopefully that helps.\n\nIn response to this comment, and I'll be frank and say that much of the terminology went way above my head, I say:\n\n&gt; Oh, so in essence, there's a lot more uncertainty being dealt with in HMM's?\n\nI continue the above remark by giving what I think is a possible implementation for iPhone's autocomplete &amp; correction functionality, which I've been told IS a HMM (I'll refrain from naming names, but he's academic who's friends with someone who worked with the team at Apple that implemented its phone's autocomplete &amp; correct - yes, I do believe him). \n\nNow in the context of that comment, I get upvoted - hopefully a sign that my hunch was correct - and then /u/romanows responded with: \n\n&gt; More uncertainty because you can't observe the thing that is \"causing\" (or \"generating\") the only things you can observe. And the things you can observe are noisy. [..]\n\nSo with all that said, let me describe the latest implementation of the autocomplete module (the version in which I'm confused about):\n\nUsing a basic \"fat-finger\" model like so: \n\n    NEARBY_KEYS = {\n        'a': 'qwsz',\n        'b': 'vghn',\n        'c': 'xdfv',\n        'd': 'erfcxs',\n        'e': 'rdsw',\n        'f': 'rtgvcd',\n        ... }\n\nand assuming that you're attempting to write say... *body*:\n\n    autocomplete.predict('the','bo')\n    \n    [('bone', 175),\n     ('body', 149),\n     ('bones', 122),\n     ('boy', 46),\n     ('bottom', 32),\n     ('box', 24),\n     ...]\n\nand then you make the error of typing an \"f\" instead of a \"d\", the current implementation will \nrecognize the \"f\" in \"bof\", and it will also use the fat-finger model to produce: \n\n    [\"bor\", \"bot\", \"bog\", \"bov\", \"boc\", \"bod\", \"bof\"]\n\nConditioned on \"the\", the implementation will then query for the top N frequent words prefixed by \nany one of the above \"bo[rtgvcdf]\" strings, resulting in:\n\n    autocomplete.predict('the','bof')\n\n    [('body', 149),\n     ('bottom', 32),\n     ('borzois', 16),\n     ('bottle', 13),\n     ('bodies', 13),\n     ('border', 12)\n     ...]\n\nYou can find the code where this occurs [here](https://github.com/rodricios/autocomplete/blob/master/autocomplete/autocomplete.py#L52)\n\nFinally to my question: does the \"hidden\" step of generating potential fat-finger candidates constitute the \"hidden\" step in HMM's? Or is what I did just a clever hack?\n\nAny insight is welcomed and appreciated! \n\nI guess I should also note that I do have an agenda with this post. An objective of mine is to come up with simple explanations and applications to some of the \"introductory\" machine learning material; basically approaching some of these concepts with intuition rather than theoretical foundation. I'm really not trying to enter a debate about which approach to learning is \"better,\" I'm just trying to lower the barrier to entry and get more young'ins and practically anyone into this awesome field of study!\n\ntl;dr: \n\nI'm out to get your kids! Jk (read the last paragraph if you were creeped out). I originally built an autocomplete module via a Markov chain. I recently added a \"fat-finger\" error model to take into account the possibility that the user mistyped a letter, and provide the suggestions based off those extra considerations. Now I'm trying to see if the implementation is actually a HMM. But I'm insecure about my own understanding of what is \"required\" for such an implementation.\n\nEdit: clarified that the current version of [autocomplete](https://github.com/rodricios/autocomplete) is the implementation I'm having questions about.","media":null,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","hide_score":false,"created_utc":"1426997681","author_flair_text":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"MachineLearning","title":"Is this a Hidden Markov Model?","secure_media_embed":{},"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","distinguished":null}

I have always loved the elegance and effectiveness of mind-maps in learning and brainstorming, and this is my attempt at building an intelligent system to develop them in an automated way. When I started out, these were my ideas(you may say a road-map) for the project-\n\n1. To be able to generate a graphical representation of the information in a text document (Basically a mind-map) - irrespective of language/content.\n2. Test it out on various sources of knowledge such as Wikipedia, Twitter, etc.\n3. Being able to use it as a knowledge exploration/brainstorming tool. How? Something like this-\na. Take a starting phrase(the initial idea) and search it up on say, Twitter.\nb. Extract the top N tweets on the search item from Twitter, and construct a text document from it.\nc. Generate a Mind-Map from the document, with a few, 'most-important' nodes.\nd. Let the user look at the Map, and decide the direction in which he wants to continue the 'exploration'. He does this by clicking on a node. Now repeat from Step a.\n\nI may be thinking pretty idealistically, assuming that 'good-quality' Mind-Maps can be generated by a computer, that too without any other source of knowledge. In any case, the code is here: https://github.com/sachinrjoglekar/MapGeist, and if you are interested in the inner mechanisms, its all written here: https://github.com/sachinrjoglekar/MapGeist/blob/master/docs/methodology.pdf (I basically use word co-occurence similarities to build a distance matrix, and then use an MST algorithm on it).\n\n\nHere are a few things I want to ask your opinion on (especially the Text Mining/ Graph Theory/ Clustering experts here)-\n\n1. The tool seems to work well on documents that have good knowledge content. Here are the Mind-Maps I generated on Machine Learning-\na. http://imgur.com/GhQo6Hc - From the Wikipedia article on Machine Learning\nb. http://imgur.com/VXmVF8W - From the top 1000 tweets about Machine Learning as on 25/3/2015 (Some noisy stuff here).\nHowever, on say something like the Wikipedia article on Breaking Bad, things start going awry. Heres the Mind-Map: http://imgur.com/2wSKTmr. Is it only because the topic in question doesnt have properly defined sub-domains like 'Machine Learning' does, or maybe I could improve things in some way (You might want to read the document on the mechanisms behind MapGeist).\n2. Any ideas on how a knowledge source like say DMOZ will help? However, this would mean the tool would be language-specific. I had also thought of using the page-links data that can be fetched from Wikipedia - I would group all keywords extracted from the document and categorize them (using occurences in the document) into one of the links, and then build a Map from the links themselves.\n3. Any better way to perform the two main tasks involved-\na. Build a distance matrix involving all the key terms/phrases in the document.\nb. Generating a Mind-Map using the above distance matrix.\n\nAny other ideas/feedback are also welcome! I have been doing trial-and-error for a long time now on the code, so I want a fresh set of ideas/opinions to move forward. If possible, feel free to fork the code and send a PR - nothing better than an additional set of hands!\n\n\n(Sorry about the really long post)\nCheers!","media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/30gq6v/help_need_with_text_mininggraph_theory_idea/","is_self":true,"from":null,"author":"sachinrjoglekar","link_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"name":"t3_30gq6v","archived":false,"id":"30gq6v","num_comments":9,"author_flair_css_class":null,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"score":5,"edited":false,"quarantine":false,"stickied":false,"from_id":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/30gq6v/help_need_with_text_mininggraph_theory_idea/","secure_media":null,"created":1427439003,"from_kind":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv"}

The ultimate learning task is something I'm still building up to but I plan to use a sequence-to-sequence on sentences.\n\nAn idea I've had (but not yet implemented) to help learning is to try to use word2vec as a source of \"dark nowledge\" for my network.  This can take many forms but for instance instead of only inputing 1-hot-encoded dictionary entries I can supplement them with the relevant word2vec vector.  Also for the output targets I was thinking that rather than using 1-hot-encoded vectors I could compute a probability distribution over the entire dictionary by using the cosine distance (in word2vec) from the expected word.  This would generate \"soft\" targets similar to the dark-knowledge paper.  I think this would also help with less frequent words because they would also be trained a little whenever a \"nearby\" word showed up.  The idea is that if one replaced words in a sentence with their word2vec neighbors the sentence might still be comprehensible if inaccurate.\n\nAnother idea is to switch from classification to regression and simply aim to output the word2vec of a given word (this would vastly reduce the input/output dimensionality).  One could then \"beam search\" output sentences (when doing sequence-to-sequence in a generative way) using word2vec proximity and then use some other technique to rank the outputs.\n\nAs I said I haven't implemented any of this yet but so I'd be very happy get some feedback on the idea.","permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/30hwk5/idea_using_word2vec_for_dark_knowledge/","link_flair_text":null,"is_self":true,"author":"spurious_recollectio","from":null,"archived":false,"id":"30hwk5","name":"t3_30hwk5","gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":5,"quarantine":false,"score":6,"edited":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","created":1427471974,"from_kind":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/30hwk5/idea_using_word2vec_for_dark_knowledge/","secure_media":null,"from_id":null}

The variational autoencoder for a random variable y, produces samples from p(y).

Since the data changes so much from week to week, if we pick a model for each time series and use it for as short as a month, we find it often behaves very poorly. This is even true if we allow the parameters of the model to vary - sometimes the best thing to do is ditch that type of model altogether and use something else (i.e. linear instead of quadratic, apply different transformations, etc...).\n\nEffectively, what this means is lots of computational and operational overhead - each week we need to rerun the entire forecasting and model selection process (hundreds of models each, times thousands of time series), and cross-validate each model for each time series.\n\nI don't think we're doing any *wrong*, but I definitely feel like we're doing too much work. How often to you revisit your choice of model at your job?

This works for simple shapes, but there is a problem for complex objects (for example a biological object like an animal, an organ, or even a molecule) that has critically important but relatively *small features*. A global metric like the CCC is size-weighted: features of smaller sizes contribute less to the score! Yet these features are *more* important than the overall shape match. Are there alternative scoring functions that are multi-scale?\n\n**Example**: matching a human body model to an image. It's quite easy to match the overall shape with a model. What we really care about are smaller-scale features like limb orientation, facial expressions, skin blemishes, all kinds of stuff. A global shape metric will not be affected by matching to these relatively small features.\n\nAnother way to think about this is in Fourier space. A complex object with lots of detail will have signal all the way out to high-frequency ranges. The high-frequency ranges are where the most important details exist. One idea is to calculate the CCC at different levels of frequency filtering and combine them somehow. However, the structure might not be uniformly multi-scale (for example, the image might be blurrier in some spots) so we may need to do this in real space.\n\nAny thoughts?","retrieved_on":1440828392,"ups":2,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"MachineLearning","created_utc":"1427501756","author_flair_text":null,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","hide_score":false,"distinguished":null,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","title":"Multi-scale shape matching","secure_media_embed":{}}

I have tried standard deviation, mean and other statistical methods (median,mode). When I do perform classification using MATLab Neural Network ToolBox it doesn't work accordingly as certain classes have similar vector values.\n\nMy supervisor for this project is not sure of my error as he claims many students from the past didn't have any issues with recognition system and the feature extraction. \n\n\nI am aware that DTW and other feature matching techniques can resolve this problem however I have to use Neural Network for the recogintion. \n\n\nYour help is much appreciated as I approach the deadline of my final year project.\n\nThank you in advance.  \n","media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/30q9s9/how_to_process_mfcc_vectors_to_be_used_for_neural/","secure_media_embed":{},"title":"How to process MFCC Vectors to be used for Neural Network","thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"distinguished":null,"hide_score":false,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1427658778","subreddit":"MachineLearning","media_embed":{}}

By 'large' I mean: too large to keep loaded in RAM completely, i.e. more than a couple of GB. There seem to be quite a few options these days and people don't usually talk about this 'technical detail'. \n\nI guess the main requirements would be lightning fast reads and compactness (i.e. compression is a plus).\n\nI've used numpy array files, Python pickle files and HDF5 files in the past. When I work with JPEG images, I tend to just keep them in that format because any form of pre-processing or conversion tends to make them take up a lot more disk space, and there is a potential loss of fidelity as well.\n\nAll of these approaches have their own problems. bcolz ( http://bcolz.blosc.org/ ) looks really interesting but I haven't used it. Caffe (which I've never used either) seems to use LevelDB or LMDB for storage, what are the advantages of that?\n\nIs there any literature (blog posts, papers, ...) that discusses this? I'd also be very interested to hear everyone's experiences.\n\nPersonally I was a big fan of HDF5 until I found out that the h5py module for Python holds on to the GIL during HDF5 file reads and does not play well with threading / multiprocessing. When training a convnet it's nice to be able to load data in parallel with training, so that turned out to be an issue sometimes.","media":null,"ups":13,"retrieved_on":1440823367,"num_comments":15,"author_flair_css_class":null,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t3_30ui94","gilded":0,"archived":false,"id":"30ui94","from":null,"author":"benanne","is_self":true,"from_id":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/30ui94/storage_formats_for_large_datasets/","secure_media":null,"from_kind":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","created":1427751470,"stickied":false,"edited":false,"score":13,"quarantine":false}

I think my problem is a supervised learning classification problem (correct me if I am wrong). How can I construct a solid training set that I can use as input for building my model? The current log files have no indicators whether a user is a human or a bot. My current idea is to construct the training set myself by defining certain thresholds (e.g. if requests/min &gt; 1000 and ... then 'bot' else 'human').\n\n2. Given the problem what (supervised) algorithms are best fit for training the models?\n\n3. What features are 'contributing' to a user being either a human or a bot. Could unsupervised dimensionality reduction (like PCA) be useful here and if so, how should I approach this?\n\n4. Could unsupervised learning (like clustering) help me with solving the given problem and if so, what unsupervised algorithms could be of use?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAny advice regarding where to start, where to find relevant (beginner-friendly) literature or general guidelines as to how I could approach the problem are highly appreciated.\nOf course any thoughts are welcome.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI want to thank those that took the time to read my post.\nI am happy to answer any questions you might have!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEdit: As requested I provided some samples of the log data I want to analyse using unsupervised learning techniques.","retrieved_on":1440822017,"ups":7,"subreddit":"MachineLearning","media_embed":{},"author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1427811347","hide_score":false,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","distinguished":null,"thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"Graduation Project: anomaly detection in log files","created":1427814947,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","from_kind":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/30xek9/graduation_project_anomaly_detection_in_log_files/","secure_media":null,"from_id":null,"stickied":false,"quarantine":false,"score":7,"edited":1428412381,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":12,"id":"30xek9","archived":false,"gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t3_30xek9","author":"Bazzibit","from":null,"is_self":true}

I figured I could do any even number of elements as a batch and do the final as a standard (online) propagation.\n\nBut I was worried that trying to implement rprop (which relies on batch processing?) that the last unbatched (and non rprop) element is gonna destabilize the minimal directions the [rprop] deltas were trying to achieve.\n\nUpdate:\n\nSo far I'm testing with 10 training samples in a simple XOR setup following the data [here](http://www.heatonresearch.com/wiki/Back_Propagation).\n\nThe batches are 4 gradients each.

{"ups":2,"retrieved_on":1440821472,"selftext":"I am trying to use the q-learning algorithm with artificial neural networks but I am having some issues. Currently, I have a neural network with inputs: {state + actions} and an output: {q}. Each tick, it either evaluates which action produces the best reward or it picks a random action. After each action is performed, it updates the neural network with the value: `r + (gamma * maxQ(s'))` using back propagation where r is the reward for performing action `a` in state `s`, `gamma` is the long term reward ratio (set at 0.8) and `maxQ(s')` is the maximum reward for performing any action in state `s'`.\n\nThe goal of this is to control a virtual 2d robot with 9 distance sensors on the front ranging from -90\u00ba to 90\u00ba. The robot can either turn -3\u00ba, 0\u00ba or 3\u00ba each tick. The sensors are set to 1.0 and can gradually move to 0.0 when an obstacle is within 100px. The robot is rewarded when it moves in a straight line and receives a negative reward when it hits a wall or performs two full turns. Unfortunately, when I run the simulation, the robot will run into the wall a few times and then begin to spiral indefinitely. Although, the robot succeeds in avoiding the walls (for the most part), I would like it to perform more like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOgSC---rgM).\n\nI have seen a few other projects that mention methods to prevent the neural network from forgetting like replaying experiences. I am not sure if those will help here because I don't quite know why it doesn't perform the way I would like.","media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/30yklq/trying_to_apply_qlearning_to_anns/","secure_media_embed":{},"title":"Trying to apply Q-Learning to ANNs","thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"distinguished":null,"hide_score":false,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1427829658","subreddit":"MachineLearning","media_embed":{},"score":2,"edited":false,"quarantine":false,"stickied":false,"from_id":null,"from_kind":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","created":1427833258,"secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/30yklq/trying_to_apply_qlearning_to_anns/","is_self":true,"from":null,"author":"Ha550","name":"t3_30yklq","gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"id":"30yklq","archived":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":4,"over_18":false,"saved":false}
