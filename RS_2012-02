Are there advantages in terms of accuracy? From what I&amp;#39;ve read it doesn&amp;#39;t look like it so I was wondering what the advantage of using MKL over an SVM would be? Or is it dependent on what MKL algorithm is used?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","created":1330424283,"hidden":false,"over_18":false}
