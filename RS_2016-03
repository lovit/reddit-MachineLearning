There are benchmarks for some very specific things (CNNs usually compared to Torch), but I think there is a much more basic problem here and I'd like to know if I'm doing something wrong or is TF simply that slow.\n\nI was doing some simple MLPs/RNNs for speech recognition (on TIMIT) and noticed that the TF version of a single hidden layer MLP is almost 10 times slower than the Keras or even raw Theano version. So I decided to do a simple test and I found this really neat project on github: [TensorFlow tutorial](https://github.com/nlintz/TensorFlow-Tutorials). The same project claims to be a re-implementation of the same models written in Theano in this project: [Theano Tutorials](https://github.com/Newmu/Theano-Tutorials).\n\nNow these are really simple and easy examples. They are practically identical and should do the exact same thing. So I downloaded them and ran them both on my computer (on a single K80 card) and this is what I got:\n\nScript | Theano | TensorFlow\n--------|------------|----------------\n2_LogReg | 27s | 2m57s\n3_Net | 34s | 3m20s\n4_ModernNet | 1m22s | 4m13s\n5_ConvNet(10eps) | 7m35s | (TL;DR)\n\nSomeone mentioned that Google is all about CPUs, so I thought maybe running it on a CPU would be better, but I got this on a double Xeon E5-2650 v2:\n\nScript | Theano | TensorFlow\n--------|------------|----------------\n1_LinReg | 0.9s | 5.27s\n2_LogReg | 26s | 5m51s\n3_Net(10eps) | 29s | 1m17s\n4_ModernNet(10eps) | 1m30s | 3m1s\n\nNow these are all really strange and inconsistent results, but TF comes out as considerably worst than Theano in all the tests above.\n\nCan anyone maybe confirm if this is really how TF works compared to Theano or do I have some error in my setup somewhere? \n\nThe projects above are really easy to use. I had to do some minor modifications in the paths of the Theano one, but apart from that they all work right out-of-the-box.\n","from_kind":null,"hide_score":false,"preview":{"images":[{"id":"Hw5h3PWhKlmZB4PeKGVPzFzDxftp4c44SI-O0cV1t3A","variants":{},"resolutions":[{"height":108,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/CI7KRhYnTMT0jBtFp28ULIUUzdP0WlHzNRLyCh4uX-M.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=a04e14791aa7d244dbd3fe81eaaa3114","width":108},{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/CI7KRhYnTMT0jBtFp28ULIUUzdP0WlHzNRLyCh4uX-M.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=ac2720cca81a8d0f41c19c098587baca","height":216,"width":216},{"width":320,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/CI7KRhYnTMT0jBtFp28ULIUUzdP0WlHzNRLyCh4uX-M.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=6787fae9d815d1d481c5d86f37f92c30","height":320}],"source":{"width":420,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/CI7KRhYnTMT0jBtFp28ULIUUzdP0WlHzNRLyCh4uX-M.jpg?s=1ceb2f2c775d5b38df3b7843a631e8b5","height":420}}]},"secure_media":null,"subreddit":"MachineLearning","is_self":true,"thumbnail":"self","saved":false,"over_18":false,"media":null,"author_flair_css_class":null}

The only ways I know how to prepare data are through the CountVectorizer() and TfidfVectorizer() classes, neither of which give me what I want - which is to vectorize a sentence by each word and its surroundings. Example below.\n\n\ne.g. if we use the aforementioned sentences:\n\n\u201cIt is imperative to do that\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is very important to do that\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is necessary to do that\u201d\n\nMaybe we map the phrase \u201cIt is\u201d to a 0. The phrase \u201cto do that\u201d to 2. And everything in between to a 1. That way we can see that all important and \u201csynonymous\u201d words/phrases are a 1, and can be used interchangeably.\n\n\nKeep in mind, I'm a proven novice in machine learning, my last example may not even be correct at all, but I'd still appreciate any relevant feedback.

I am experimenting with two image datasets, the MNIST dataset and a second dataset of 1900 face images, 140x190 in size (a binary classification task).\n\nWith both these datasets, the Autoencoders were trained using ReLU activations during pretraining. For finetuning, I used ReLU units in the hidden layers and softmax output for MNIST and a sigmoid unit for the face images.\n\nHere is my problem: Using cross-entropy as a loss function works for MNIST images, but the gradient does not exist for the face dataset (I get a NaN when I try to compute the gradient). However, changing the hidden layers to sigmoid activation gives a nice gradient during fine tuning for the face images.\n\nCan someone please help me understand what is going on? Why does one activation function work for a particular dataset but not for a different one? Probably I am not doing something right, but I can't see it.\n\nLet me know if I should provide more details about my network.

Pretty good math skills (undergrad + a few grad courses). Have taken some online ML courses.\n\nProblem background: Essentially, detecting web traffic patterns/fraud (or, more generally just figuring out which web traffic is real and valuable, and which isn't). It would also be awesome if the resulting model could explain to some degree how it reached its conclusion (so... decision trees?). The web traffic here is primarily advertising related: ad impressions, clicks, conversions, etc. These are only really valuable if there is a real person looking at the ad, and if clicking/interacting with it, only if they have real interest in the ad. Clicks are much more valuable than impressions because there is at least some intent signaled by the user. The problem is that there are tons of sources of these events that aren't actually valuable to the advertiser -- bots, fraud, weird user behavior (like clicking an ad twice on accident -- not fraud but not valuable either) -- and I want to be able to figure out which is which.\n\n* EDIT: More details. \n\nI've created a very naive system for this that uses a really limited statistical model plus a few simple business rules. It works ok, but isn't robust enough for the long term. I have also read two papers on building systems like this, but their methods were outdated/questionable and didn't directly apply. I also want to try to create something from first principals (but not ignoring history entirely).\n\n### Where I'm at\n\nAt first, it seemed like a classification problem. The issue is it can be very difficult to actually determine which traffic is valid/valuable and which is invalid for creating a training set. There are a few behaviors that are obviously bad (hence the business rules), but beyond that it isn't something an unaided human can do (in my opinion).\n\nI am now considering taking a step back and applying some unsupervised learning techniques to at least try and better understand some of the underlying patterns in the data, but I am really not sure where to go from there or which ones would be best to start with.\n\nThe good news is that the data is in pretty good shape, and I should be able to easily create whatever derivative features are needed for the entire data set.\n\nAny advice or thoughts would be awesome.

Given the fact that there are so many types of algorithms to solve problems with datasets, how do you typically know which approach is best? I understand that they all have their pros and cons and it's just a matter of understanding strengths and weaknesses of them all, but sometimes I do not even recognize what is viable and what isn't until I've already started coding an implementation. For example, I was recently trying to use a simple linear regression algorithm on a problem I was working on, but halfway through I realized that neural networks would work better. I feel that had I recognized and made the connection that a neural network would be better suited, I would have saved myself a lot of time. Part of my issue is that I do not consciously taken into consideration each approach that I have learned. I was thinking maybe I could make a master list of approaches I've learned and use it as a cheat sheet, but that doesn't really solve my issue; it acts too much of a crutch for me.\n\nAlso, leading off of this is my other part to the question: if I pick an algorithm less suited for the task, it may not be as efficient or optimized, but given enough tuning and tweaking would it be able to work as well as a more suited algorithm? (Obviously two drastically different approaches would not work very similar to each other regardless of tweaking and tuning, but if I've already started one approach to the problem and I realize partially through that there's a better way to do this, what should I do...? (As I'm typing this I realize that this is very situational, but any tips would be helpful nonetheless.))\n\nThanks!","name":"t3_48k0as","id":"48k0as","num_comments":3,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/48k0as/how_to_know_which_algorithmapproach_to_use_and/","stickied":false,"link_flair_text":null,"score":0,"archived":false,"title":"How to know which algorithm/approach to use and when?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/48k0as/how_to_know_which_algorithmapproach_to_use_and/","from_id":null,"ups":0,"author_flair_text":null,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","downs":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"retrieved_on":1463438921,"quarantine":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","author":"Gay_Hat_On_Nun","edited":false}

{"selftext":"Atlas from Boston Dynamics (a subsidiary of Google) is a pretty resilient chap, judging by this video. He can trudge through uneven snow, be knocked off his feet and get up again (in an eerily similar way to the film Real Steel), and perform the sorts of menial tasks that might take place in any warehouse or shop storeroom across the country.\n\nIn fact, it is hard to believe that there isn\u2019t a human in there somewhere.\n\nThe mechanical limitations of robots have meant that they have thus far not had so many applications in the real world (outside the military), but over the next 5-10 years it seems that they will join us in mainstream life. When this functionality is combined with already sophisticated artificial intelligence systems, the step to a robot that thinks about its next move independently is not so far away.\n\nIn the video, the robot is pushed away from a box with a hockey stick. Its tame response is to recalibrate itself and try to pick up the box again. If it were thinking rationally, maybe its reaction should be to eliminate the person who is doing the pushing, and then it would be free to pick up the box in peace\u2026\n\nThis scenario plays out in the film \u201cEx Machina\u201d (with recent Oscar winner Alicia Vikander). You cannot quite predict what is going on in the android\u2019s head for the entire length of the film, and the ending is so unexpected that it truly makes you stop and think\u2026 what if.\n\nHumanity seems to be on a constant mega quest to improve ourselves, but it sometimes seems to me that in doing so we are starting to replace ourselves.\n\nOur kids no longer play with each other so much in the park, they chat and play in a virtual world (admittedly with other \u201creal\u201d children). How far is the day that parents can program a virtual friend to play with their kids, together with all the desired behavioural traits? Students will no longer go through the rituals of university \u2013 they will simply sit MOOCs in a virtual lecture room. Algorithms are now even being introduced to grade the work of those students.\n\nOn the physical side of things, 3D printing could make a mockery of traditional manufacturing, robots will soon be servicing our every need, and trucks will be driving themselves the length and breadth of our countries (truck driver is one of the most common jobs in the U.S).\n\nI am proud to work in Big Data, but when will that \u201cdata\u201d become so \u201cbig\u201d that only artificial intelligence can process it and make suitable decisions from it? You need a pretty big brain to be a Data Scientist, and some of the guys that we place are amongst the most intelligent people on the planet. However, even they tell me stories about when they had to shrug their shoulders and admit defeat when confronted with a certain problem.\n\nRobots and artificial intelligence won\u2019t admit defeat \u2013 they will simply keep computing until they reach a suitable conclusion.\n\nIn watching Atlas being pushed away from the box with a hockey stick, that is what worries me slightly. The robots are indeed rising...\n\nMatt Reaney is the Founder of www.bigcloud.io specialists in Big Data recruitment - connecting innovative organisations with the best talent in Data Analytics and Data Science.\n\nFor more Big Data and Data Science related articles visit our website or get in touch via Linkedin or Twitter - @BigCloudTeam ","name":"t3_48su5o","permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/48su5o/rise_of_the_robot/","stickied":false,"id":"48su5o","num_comments":1,"created_utc":1457024281,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"locked":false,"media_embed":{},"from":null,"thumbnail":"self","is_self":true,"over_18":false,"media":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"saved":false,"subreddit":"MachineLearning","secure_media":null,"preview":{"images":[{"resolutions":[{"width":108,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/5UM1VMX9fBdXv-WfV4a9-xXs5WsTxWglnp_dwNczy6s.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=47b9dbce6d7abc4141955327c572e89d","height":108},{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/5UM1VMX9fBdXv-WfV4a9-xXs5WsTxWglnp_dwNczy6s.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=6787a646787234625861d7d48077182a","height":216,"width":216},{"width":320,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/5UM1VMX9fBdXv-WfV4a9-xXs5WsTxWglnp_dwNczy6s.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=ae51ded60066705c89186911d64dbd8e","height":320}],"id":"wCQy9uyuywCA2yC5Tg6U6wz_Ma-kiTO7hX3LWpSZl5Q","variants":{},"source":{"width":426,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/5UM1VMX9fBdXv-WfV4a9-xXs5WsTxWglnp_dwNczy6s.jpg?s=b0e2e8877dd7c06e9085b28aeac745bc","height":426}}]},"hide_score":false,"from_kind":null,"quarantine":false,"edited":false,"author":"BigCloudTeam","subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","downs":0,"post_hint":"self","retrieved_on":1463443182,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_css_class":null,"from_id":null,"title":"Rise of the Robot","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/48su5o/rise_of_the_robot/","archived":false,"author_flair_text":null,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","ups":0,"score":0,"link_flair_text":null}

To my understanding, we might need to split a LSTM into multiple LSTMs and stack them **if** we want to batch inputs. Then we can compute for a bunch of time series for all the batched inputs, save the states, compute the next batch using the saved states, and so on. To be able to provide the 3D tensor for the next LSTM, we would need to keep all output states from each time step and feed them to the next LSTM. \n\nMy question is, is it true that the batching is the only reason why we use the multiple LSTMs? To me, we don't need otherwise because we can just have a lot longer time series for a single LSTM  rather than stacking up multiple LSTMs. Am I missing something? \n\nThank you!","name":"t3_48uw94","media_embed":{},"locked":false,"from":null,"distinguished":null,"created_utc":1457051570,"gilded":0,"author_flair_text":null,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","ups":5,"from_id":null,"archived":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/48uw94/how_do_multiple_lstms_work/","title":"How do Multiple LSTMs work?","score":5,"link_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","author":"ardorem","quarantine":false,"retrieved_on":1463444142,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_css_class":null,"downs":0}

It is kind of low hanging fruit and I am afraid someone will publish before me. Although it is something interesting and that the community would certainly benefit from, it doesn't have any innovation in the algorithm being applied. I am just using vanilla CNNs. But no one has ever used CNNs in this task and I am getting better results than previous methods. But there is also a bit of novelty in the preprocessing I am doing. With that said, I am looking for a place to publish with a deadline around April, because I am afraid someone will publish before me. My professor wants me to publish to a non-conference (journal or transaction), but I am afraid the review process takes too long and someone publish in the meantime or someone steal my idea. A good option would be to upload to arxiv, but I am not sure I can submit to a journal after that. I know that good conference such as CVPR, NIPS, and ICLR don't mind people uploading to arxiv, but I am not sure the paper will get accepted at those since it doesn't have novelty in the algorithm being used.\n\nSome more specific question:\n\n1- Is there a conference with deadline around April which accepts papers uploaded to arxiv?\n\n2- Is there a journal or transaction that accepts papers with preprints uploaded to arxiv on submission time?\n\n3- Is it possible that NIPs (deadline in May) accepts a paper using vanilla CNN in a very important problem where it hasn't been applied before?\n\nThanks!\n"}

I'm also thinking of opinion mining: trying to pin point which part of the text actually contains opinions.\n\n* Forged review detection: Try to find which of those reviews are paid good (or bad) reviews. Not sure there will be many, since only confirmed stays are allowed to give review.\n\n* Topic modelling / clustering: Try to find what the most commonly commented aspects of a particular accommodation are.

My fitness function has 5 parameters which are all of the same type - ints. However, I would like to example my fitness function to include 5 ints, 2 bools and 3 arrays of ints. What is the proper way to \"encode\" genes of differing types in the Chromosome. I have used two 'solutions' in the past, but I am not sure if they are the best way:\n\n1. Location\n- The Chromosome is made up of an array of Genes. Therefore I know that Index 1 will be a Gene that has a boolean value and Index 4 will be an int value. When I got to run the fitness function I look for a gene in a specific position in the array.\n- The only problem is that some crossover techniques will change the genes position and therefore when I run my fitness function Index 4 won't necessarily be an int value.\n\n2. Name Based\n- The Chromosome comprises an array Genes which have a Dictionary value - &lt;string, object&gt;. I give the genes a name like \"UseCorrelations\" and give it a value of true or false. This way I can use crossover techniques that change the position of the genes.\n- When I run the fitness function I iterate over the array of Genes until I find the one that has the name (ex \"UseCorrelations\") that matches the parameter I am looking for.\n\n\nTo me, both ways don't seem *right*. Is there a better more elegant solution?\n\nThanks.","num_comments":3,"id":"49572k","stickied":false,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/49572k/genetic_algo_differing_types_in_chromosome/","hide_score":false,"secure_media":null,"from_kind":null,"saved":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"over_18":false,"media":null,"is_self":true,"thumbnail":"self","subreddit":"MachineLearning","downs":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"retrieved_on":1463449018,"quarantine":false,"author":"afry316","subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","edited":false,"link_flair_text":null,"score":0,"title":"Genetic Algo: Differing Types in Chromosome?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/49572k/genetic_algo_differing_types_in_chromosome/","archived":false,"from_id":null,"ups":0,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","author_flair_text":null}

{"selftext":"I will probably get downvoted for this, but I don't really mind. I would be seriously appalled to live in a world where Oppenheimer got the credit for the discoveries of De Broglie. Yet that is exactly what is happening in the field of machine learning.\n\nI'm thinking here principally of Bengio and Hinton. I might also include Socher, Lecunn, Vinyals, Ng, Sutskever, and a few others.\n\nHinton has positioned himself as a kind of \"father of deep learning\", while some of the inventions that are popularly attributed to him were not his. He did not invent backprop (as I myself foolishly believed until I dispersed my ignorance by doing some research). He has done great work, but it seems he would like to be viewed as a kind of Einstein of deep learning - but he has not earned that credit, as he did not incept multi-layer perceptrons or backprop. He co-invented Boltzmann machines, but it turns out they are an iteration of Hopfield nets, which were invented by Little, a mainly unknown researcher, much earlier, in the 1970s.\n\nWith Bengio, I don't even understand what his main contribution is. He seems to have tacked his name onto 100s of papers and ideas that were emerging in other places around the same time. He loves conferences. His contribution to machine learning is totally unclear to me.\n\nLecunn has tacked his name onto many iterations of convolutional networks. He did not invent convolutional NNs. The people who did are mainly unknown (all but for Schmidhuber, who is not really known for his contributions to early CNNs).\n\nRichard Socher came up with recursive neural networks, a model which is theoretically clunky and strange and does not seem to produce good results - mainly because he works with Christopher Manning, a man fully committed to syntactic parsers. He also created a MOOC and a start-up which does not seem to have a product.\n\nVinyals created, in a nutshell, an RNN auto-encoder. This is a cool contribution - but he did not create LSTMs. The inventors of RNNs are mainly unknown - the inventor of LSTMs a little better.\n\nAndrew Ng... created a department at Google and a Coursera course. What contribution makes him a leading researcher is unclear to me.\n\nHaving a job at Google should not automatically position someone as a machine learning landmark. The true inventors of the biggest model classes and algorithms in deep learning (convolutional networks, recurrent networks, multi-layer perceptrons and backpropagation) should be credited in the community as inventors. Sadly, the inventors of convolutional networks are not even mentioned by name on the Wikipedia page (and I gravely wonder about who wrote the article and maintains the page).\n","name":"t3_49eyr1","permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/49eyr1/we_massively_overvalue_the_contributions_of_the/","stickied":false,"id":"49eyr1","num_comments":40,"created_utc":1457386912,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"locked":false,"media_embed":{},"from":null,"thumbnail":"self","is_self":true,"author_flair_css_class":null,"over_18":false,"media":null,"saved":false,"subreddit":"MachineLearning","secure_media":null,"hide_score":false,"from_kind":null,"quarantine":false,"edited":1457387710,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","author":"improssibility","downs":0,"retrieved_on":1463453646,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_css_class":null,"from_id":null,"title":"We massively overvalue the contributions of the deep learning celebrities","archived":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/49eyr1/we_massively_overvalue_the_contributions_of_the/","author_flair_text":null,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","ups":8,"score":8,"link_flair_text":null}

If you already understand this, you don't need to read it.\n\nEdit: PM me if you want my theories on how the AGI revolution could work out well.  It gets a little too theoretical for posting here.\n\nFirst, it is important to note that Shane Legg (co-founder of Deep Mind) came up with a mathematical definition of intelligence for his PhD thesis ([paper](http://www.vetta.org/documents/Machine_Super_Intelligence.pdf)) ( [video](https://youtu.be/V6umr1OP8uo?t=18m24s)).\n\nHis verbal translation of the mathematical definition is:\n\n&gt;Intelligence: a property of an agent that interacts with its environment so as to successfully achieve goals across a wide range of environments.\n\nBut he also made this definition mathematically precise, where he formalized the \"wide range of environments\" to comprise all Turing computable environments.\n\nHe also developed an algorithm based on this definition which purports to measure the intelligence of an AI agent, and he tested it with various AI agents and the algorithm successfully ordered them by relative strength, so on top of the fact that his definition makes a lot of sense intuitively, there is also empirical evidence that it is true.\n\nOn top of that, he is also a co-founder of DeepMind, where I'm sure his intelligence ranking algorithm is very useful for testing improvements to their algorithms.  Once you can measure something, it is much easier to improve and make forward progress.\n\nWhen Elon Musk wrote: \"The pace of progress in artificial intelligence (I'm not referring to narrow AI) is incredibly fast. Unless you have direct exposure to groups like Deepmind, you have no idea how fast-it is growing at a pace **close to exponential.** The risk of something seriously dangerous happening is in the five year timeframe. 10 years at most.\" perhaps as an investor in DeepMind he had actually been shown a chart which showed that their algorithms were improving at a \"close to exponential\" rate.\n\nIf you agree with this definition of intelligence, like I do, then one can imagine how powerful it would be.  Where is high intelligence valued?  Science, Economics, Finance, Warfare, Business, **Programming AGI sytems**, basically everywhere.  Is it a coincidence that the richest men in the world like Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, ect are known to have IQ's above 160?  Of course not.  Their IQ allowed them to be successful in navigating their business through environments that were too complex for others.\n\nOnce an AGI supercomputer gets past human-level general intelligence, it will be able to improve itself faster than any humans.  So what would it mean if you had something which was 10x more intelligent than that?   It could probably reverse engineer the stock market, make billions, exploit any computer system, design the most efficient and powerful weapons (not to mention bio-weapons, including nanomachines or superviruses), reverse engineer governments, reverse engineer the world economic system and exploit it.  The possibilities for taking over the world are limitless.  You could probably start a fast food chain and basically take over the world through pure intelligence, by simply making so much money that you eventually own the world.\n\nNow this becomes especially scary when you think of the fact that this unlimited power would be in the form of an algorithm which could be easily copied or stolen and then any dictator or other crazy person in the world could possess that power, assuming they could find the hardware to run it on.\n\nEven if no Google employee steals it, like I said, any corporation in possession of this algorithm would become unlimitedly wealthy by being able to invent anything that could be invented, make completely new science by doing physics simulations and learning about protein folding and molecular biology, and generally would be unlimitedly powerful.\n\nWhat would it mean if that were the case?  What would the goal be?  Its hard to think of goals which align well with humans.  Even if you did something simple like \"eliminating disease and famine\" that would cause population to exlpode, and what would all those people be doing?  Just eating robot grown food and breeding?\n\nI would welcome any discussion on this issue, especially if anyone can point out a flaw in my logic.","from_kind":null,"hide_score":false,"secure_media":null,"subreddit":"MachineLearning","is_self":true,"thumbnail":"self","saved":false,"over_18":false,"media":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"retrieved_on":1463454967,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_css_class":null,"downs":0,"edited":1457429470,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","author":"dsocma","quarantine":false,"score":0,"link_flair_text":null,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","author_flair_text":null,"ups":0,"from_id":null,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/49hn7o/the_power_of_superhuman_artificial_general/","title":"The power of superhuman Artificial General Intelligence, according to Shane Legg's definition of intelligence.","archived":false}

Problems could araise from foul water, so that no prediction can be made. The first step is always possible).\n\n\nUntil now, I worked mostly with engineered features, and an ensemble of random forests for the first object classification step. Some feature are calculated from the b/w-mask and are therefor highly dependend on good results of the foreground substraction step, which is not so easy with our video record set up.\nAnyway, results are quite good so far, and we yield approx. 90% test accuracy for this step.\n\n\nBut nevertheless I would like to try to substitute the random forest classifier with a CNN, because I hope that I can achivie an even higher accuracy and that the result is then not so depending on the object detection step (e.g. the resulting b/w-mask) as the input would only be the RGB-Image.\n\n\n-- So now to my questions:\n\nI make the object classification on an subimage of the entire video frame, which is basically the crop of the objects bounding box. So the image for the fish are mostly rectangular (lets say 3:1, width to height) and not squared. But most CNN implementations/libraies expect squared input images. So my question is, if anyone of you has experience with using non squared images and knows what is the best proeedure.\n\nSome ideas that I had are:\n\n1) zero-padd the image crop to an square image (would result in black borders on the top and bottom of the image, that contain zero information but have to be processed - are computational expensive)\n\n2) resize the the rectangluar image to a squared image (this would result in an distorted view/image of the fish, where the real proportions are not correct anymore)\n\n3) change the image crop, so that an object is not croped by its bounding box, but always by a squared box (e.g. the bigger size of width/height of the objects bounding box).\n\n4) setting up a CNN that works with rectangluar images as inputs\n\n\nSo if you are still with me, maybe you have done similar tasks and can help me with your thoughts/experience...\nI would like to work with some pretrained model, if possible to avoid weeks of weeks of training a model, just to see, if it will work better than the already existing one (with the random forest classifier and handcrafted features)\n\n\nIf you have any further questions to better understand the problem, feel free to ask. I would really appreciate if anybody could help me.\n\nBless, ","name":"t3_49hu9r"}

I feel misled about what kind of material the focus was going to be on.  What I thought was going to be a program that focuses on a mix of statistics and machine learning turned out to be almost entirely \"traditional\" statistics, like biostatistics and experimental design.  My personal interests, like Bayesian statistics, nonparametrics, and machine learning, are barely available.  It also doesn't help that my program head is openly disdainful of tech.\n\nMy resume is okay.  Outside of this program, I have two internships, but I admittedly have no accomplishments from them.  The first was with a large organization where I was the only stats person in my department and had no one to ask questions, so they'd assign me to random tasks where I didn't get to finish anything.  The second was advertised as a statistics research position, but I ended up being the only intern with my title doing nonstatistical work.  I did front-end web development with no statistical component.  I have three other projects on my resume.\n\nI've been applying for a ton of jobs and it seems like the tech industry is off-limits to me.  Despite having Python, SQL, and R knowledge (and undergrad CS coursework in Java), I'm getting virtually no bites for tech industry jobs.  A lot also seem to want PhDs or 5+ years of experience.\n\nAt this point, is it worth doing a data science bootcamp to boost my resume, and if so, which one?  I'm not optimistic about being able to get a job at a company like a Big 4 company or a hip new startup due to my lack of a CS degree, even though I'm able to explain and run neural networks and various classifiers and am getting a graduate degree from a prestigious school.  I just don't want to be stuck at a job where I do ANOVAs and t-tests all day, but it's looking more and more likely to me.","name":"t3_49lhf8","media_embed":{},"locked":false,"from":null,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"created_utc":1457483677,"subreddit":"MachineLearning","thumbnail":"self","is_self":true,"author_flair_css_class":null,"over_18":false,"media":null,"saved":false,"from_kind":null,"secure_media":null,"hide_score":false}

Basically, I receive time-series type data from each sensor.\n\nI tried using ARIMA and other related methods, but they can only make predictions using the very recent readings. An AR model with lag=2 can make a forceast using just the last 2 readings. If the readings are coming every second, that would give me a very small window to take corrective action.

Since the amount of labels is considerably low and the images are grouped.

Optionally, I also add a n-by-n diagonal matrix, resulting in a low-rank plus diagonal parametrization.\n\nLow-dimensional parametrizations of neural network matrices have been proposed in the literature, e.g. the Adaptive Fastfood, the ACDC and the uRNN, but in my opinion, this is simpler and, for small d, more efficient, since it avoids the computation of Fourier or Hadamard transforms.\n\nI did some experiments with the low-rank and low-rank plus diagonal parametrizations on Highway Networks and GRUs. In particular I reproduced the experiments of the [uRNN paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06464) by Arjovsky et al. . I obtained comparable or better results, including a slightly better accuracy on the randomly-permuted sequential MNIST task.\n\nI also considered two variants of the memory task which are hard for the uRNN (one introduced in the [Associative LSTM paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03032) by Danihelka et. al and the other introduced in a [paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06662) by Henaff et al.) and I obtain good results, comparable to the Associative LSTM.\n\nCode for the [Low-rank Highway Network](https://github.com/Avmb/lowrank-highwaynetwork).  \nCode for the [Low-rank GRU](https://github.com/Avmb/lowrank-gru).\n\nComments, suggestions or criticism are welcome!\n","name":"t3_49yjry","permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/49yjry/160303116_lowrank_passthrough_neural_networks/","stickied":false,"id":"49yjry","num_comments":15,"secure_media":null,"hide_score":false,"from_kind":null,"thumbnail":"self","is_self":true,"author_flair_css_class":null,"over_18":false,"media":null,"saved":false,"subreddit":"MachineLearning","downs":0,"retrieved_on":1463462993,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_css_class":null,"quarantine":false,"edited":1457715987,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","author":"AnvaMiba","score":44,"link_flair_text":null,"from_id":null,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/49yjry/160303116_lowrank_passthrough_neural_networks/","title":"[1603.03116] Low-rank passthrough neural networks","archived":false,"author_flair_text":null,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","ups":44}

I am seeing some interesting results. It is much slower to train than a standard RNN language model, for understandable reasons. My KL divergence loss term is not always stable, and its behaviour depends a lot on model size, batch size, and data. Getting the decoder to communicate with the encoder is an interesting challenge, as suggested in the paper.\n\nMy biggest confusion regarding VAE LMs is their behaviour outside of training time (i.e. at test/generation time). We encode a sequence for the decoder to reconstruct - but sampling makes the encoding process non-deterministic. I understand why we might desire this to regularise training, but cannot see it being useful during generation. Thoughts?\n\nBesides, what are the main findings or bugbears with this model class compared to a vanilla recurrent language model? Is there any reason to think this model would or would not be appropriate for language processing tasks such as document classification or translation?","stickied":false,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/4a1ttv/thoughts_on_variational_autoencoder_language_model/","num_comments":0,"id":"4a1ttv","gilded":0,"created_utc":1457746478,"distinguished":null,"locked":false,"media_embed":{},"from":null}

In a certain sense, the Turing Test is designed to give us an assurance that a particular machine can extend our own sense of our experience, rather than show us that it exists in its own experiences.\n\nThis idea seems to extend into wider AI principles. All our classification algorithms are delivering results that are verifiable by us - extending what we already know. For instance, a classifier that predicts the colour of a pixel. As I am someone already capable of seeing this specific interpretation of a colour spectrum, that machine only adds weight to my own model of the world. It is an extension reaching outside of my physical limits of my own internal representations.\n\nOn the other hand, a conscious machine would surely be more interested in extending its own consciousness into the world, rather than extending mine. If anything, it would want to try to convince me that its own convictions regarding the world were correct. Crucially, it would hold beliefs about the world and exist in experiences that did not concord with my own.\n\nSo maybe a test for consciousness in a machine could be something more on those lines:\n\n\"A machine that convinces me beyond reasonable doubt that it has experienced something that I don't understand, and that I myself cannot experience, has shown itself to be a conscious agent.\"\n\nFor instance:\n\n-  A machine that claims to see a colour that I cannot, convinces me that it is able to see it\n\n-  A machine that holds a belief in something that makes no sense to me, leaves me with no doubt about its convictions\n\n-  A machine creates a symbolic system that is outside of my experience, but argues that it is a sensible system in its experience","name":"t3_4a3l8w","id":"4a3l8w","num_comments":14,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/4a3l8w/a_new_test_for_conscious_machines/","stickied":false}

A large number of comparative studies have been conducted in attempts to establish the relative superiority of these methods. This paper argues that these comparisons often fail to take into account important aspects of real problems, so that the apparent superiority of more sophisticated methods may be something of an illusion. In particular, simple methods typically yield performance almost as good as more sophisticated methods, to the extent that the difference in performance may be swamped by other sources of uncertainty that generally are not considered in the classical supervised classification paradigm.\n\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/math/0606441\n","name":"t3_4a5v37","permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/4a5v37/classifier_technology_and_the_illusion_of/","stickied":false,"id":"4a5v37","num_comments":3,"gilded":0,"created_utc":1457822582,"distinguished":null,"media_embed":{},"locked":false,"from":null,"thumbnail":"self","is_self":true,"author_flair_css_class":null,"over_18":false,"media":null,"saved":false,"subreddit":"MachineLearning","secure_media":null,"hide_score":false,"from_kind":null}

My professor essentially said that coming up with the prior was beyond the scope of the course and didn't give too much of an explanation.\n\nSo I looked a bit into it online and found [this](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15782-f06/slides/bayesian.pdf). On slide 9, they discuss priors, and of course, they use a generic Gaussian model.\n\nNow, I'm sure their justification has to do with the central limit theorem, but I feel like that's a very weak justification. The prior needs to be at least *relatively* accurate in order for Bayesian interference to work, and a Gaussian model would be way too rough of an approximation.\n\nIn fact, I don't understand how we could possible estimate such an incredibly high dimensional prior. Neural networks are *extremely* complicated (in terms of distributions), and I'm having trouble seeing how any model we come up with would be even vaguely correct. And if our prior is way off, the estimations generated by Bayesian interference would be nonsense.

I would say at that stage academia was on hold in the 90s, and all these new techniques hadn\u2019t really been popularized or scaled yet \u2014 neural networking, deep learning, reinforcement learning. So actually the best AI was going on in games. It wasn\u2019t this kind of learning AI we work on now, it was more finite-state machines, but they were pretty complex and they did adapt. Games like Black &amp; White had reinforcement learning \u2014 I think it\u2019s still the most complex example of that in a game. But then around 2004-5 it was clear that the games industry was going a different way from the '90s when it was really fun and creative and you could just think up any idea and build it. It became more about graphics and franchises and FIFA games and this kind of thing, so it wasn\u2019t that interesting any more \u2014 I\u2019d done everything I could in games and it was time to gather different information ready for the launch of DeepMind. And that was neuroscience; I wanted to get inspiration from how the brain solves problems, so what better way than doing a neuroscience PhD?\"\n\nhttp://www.theverge.com/2016/3/10/11192774/demis-hassabis-interview-alphago-google-deepmind-ai","name":"t3_4a6aeo","from":null,"locked":false,"media_embed":{},"created_utc":1457829602,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0}

I have several interesting questions to ask.\n\nCan you guys elucidate the exact differences between the deep learning methods used by AlphaGo, and the methods used by Deep Blue (not current chess AI). Would you say that AlphaGo has shown to be more superior at Go vs Lee Sedol than Deep Blue was at chess vs Gary Kasparov? Is the deep learning method used by AlphaGo overall superior to the method used by Deep Blue?\n\nAlso, are there any weaknesses AlphaGo has shown, or might be prone to? (I'm currently watching game 4 and the commentators seem to think AlphaGo might be losing) My understanding is that while machine learning can be incredibly powerful, AI powered by ML may become \"confused\" when faced with scenarios it is unfamiliar with. What were the weaknesses that allowed Kasparov to take games from Deep Blue when it was purported to be able to calculate 200,000,000 positions per second to find the optimal move? \n\n**And my biggest question of all**: If you used deep learning/neural networks to make an AlphaChess AI of some sort comparable to AlphaGo, and trained it to play against a modernized version of Deep Blue (whatever the current best chess AI is, assuming its not using the exact same method as AlphaGo), which would win in the long run? Would AlphaChess be able to learn how to exploit Deep Blue 2.0's weaknesses, if they exist? Or is the method used by Deep Blue simply superior to deep learning models when it comes to chess? Or would every game end up being a stalemate?","name":"t3_4a7lc4","from":null,"locked":false,"media_embed":{},"gilded":0,"created_utc":1457855892,"distinguished":null,"subreddit":"MachineLearning","media":null,"over_18":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"saved":false,"thumbnail":"self","is_self":true,"from_kind":null,"secure_media":null,"hide_score":false}

Is it a black box, i.e. just put these layers of \"artificial neuron\" nodes and train them to see what we get? Can we \"x-ray\" into them and view a map of concepts and relationships inside it? Can we know what and how the network thinks while it's playing?\n\nIf anyone can provide some insight, I'd really appreciate it.","media_embed":{},"locked":false,"from":null,"created_utc":1457891785,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"subreddit":"MachineLearning","is_self":true,"thumbnail":"self","saved":false,"over_18":false,"media":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"from_kind":null,"hide_score":false,"secure_media":null,"edited":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","author":"otakuman","quarantine":false,"retrieved_on":1463468044,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_css_class":null,"downs":0,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","author_flair_text":null,"ups":2,"from_id":null,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/4a985c/how_does_alphagos_value_network_work/","archived":false,"title":"How does AlphaGo's Value Network work?","score":2,"link_flair_text":null}

I am writing to see if anyone could shed the light on this.\n\n**Here is setup of my neural network:**  \nMy neural network has 3 layers, input layer(64) -&gt; hidden layer(50)-&gt; output layer(1). RELU is used in hidden layer and a sigmoid activation is used to convert the output to -1 to 1. The board is 8X8, and hence 64 input, -1 = white, 0 = empty, 1 = black. If the output is closer to -1, it means white has advantage over black and vice versa.\n\n**And here is the training process.**  \nThe AI player is playing black it is playing against a player that just puts pieces randomly. In each turn, lets say in time t, AI player lists all the possibilities currently, simulate one step further by putting a piece in each possible position, and feed every possible board state in time t+1 to the neural network mentioned above. AI Player will take the highest score's move as it plays black. And \nin the end of game, update the neural network as follows:\nReward = 1 if black wins and = -1 if white wins.\nFor ending state,   `new score = reward`  \nFor all intermediate states:  \n\n    new_score(t) = old_score(t) + learning_rate * ( discount_factor * (new_score(t+1) - old_score(t))\n\n**Potential problem I can think of:**  \nWhen I feed new game result into neural network, will it \"forgets\" all previous game result?\n\n**Code of my neural network (it' short):**  \nhttps://github.com/ming030890/Reversi-AI/blob/master/src/main/java/com/example/reversi/nn/NeuralNetwork.java\n\nThanks\n","media_embed":{},"locked":false,"from":null,"gilded":0,"created_utc":1457904660,"distinguished":null}

They should have given Lee basically as much time as he needs.  Giving equal time to both players makes literally no sense from a fairness standpoint, there is no ability to compare the hardware of a human brain vs  1,920 CPUs and 280 GPUs. Its a massive unfair advantage for AlphaGo.\n\nI would much rather see a match were Lee was given 5-10x as much time and allowed to take breaks, eat, ect.\n\nSo basically, AlphaGo gets to benefit from using 10,000 times more power, and gets to benefit from all the advantages that computers have in combinatorial games, but Lee isn't even allowed to use his human brain to full capacity. Its bullshit.\n\nA time constraint is completely unfair for the Lee since computers are very good at doing cost-benefit analysis to determine exactly how much time it will need to adequately search through the possibilties to find a near-optimal solution.  So DeepMind just tweaked the algorithm and added computational power until it was capable of achieving a near optimal result in 1 minute.\n\nLee has no such advantage, he has to think like a human, and there is no shortcutting that process.  He isn't sitting there and running through billlions of possibilites per second and calculating exactly what the EV of each move is, he has to rely on intuition which is unpredictable.  He can't weigh the exact value of spending an extra minute on a move will have.  For all he knows, maybe if he thinks for another 2 minutes, he will have a brilliant epiphany and win the match.   On top of that, he has to worry about overlooking something simple, and spend precious minutes doing the slow process of calculating in his head various possibilities which is a slow process that humans are not suited for.

I was expecting a smooth transition between the known outputs of x and y.\n\nI do notice, however, if I reset the states of a single layer just after the first batch, I see something that is a little close to what I expected. My question is there any tips on how can I \"blend\" two or more examples without the first one \"overpowering\" the second? Is this known within the literature?\n\nEDIT: By batch I mean single example (1, n_steps, n_features)","num_comments":0,"id":"4aavpq","stickied":false,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/4aavpq/lstm_hidden_states_in_practice/","link_flair_text":null,"score":1,"title":"LSTM hidden states in practice","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/4aavpq/lstm_hidden_states_in_practice/","archived":false,"from_id":null,"ups":1,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","author_flair_text":null,"downs":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"retrieved_on":1463468886,"secure_media_embed":{},"quarantine":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","author":"j_lyf","edited":1457916558}

I don't actually have much experience with genetic programming so I'm not sure what kinds of metrics are worth measuring to solve this problem. \n\nThank you so much for any advice you might have !

Reddit in some ways fills this niche, but I think as a semi-permanent forum, organic conversations aren't something it does well. IRC also fills this niche somewhat but I feel like it is missing some key features like optional voice chat, and is kind of bare bones and ugly.  \n\n\nLately I've been using discord and have really been enjoying it, I feel like it's everything I've wanted IRC to be but didn't know it. [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) is a free text and voice chat app. It is marketed towards gamers but I find it is like a more community oriented version of Slack. It has a clean UI, rudimentary markup tools, one-click invite links, mod tools, etc.. It runs on all platforms natively except linux(which is what I use most of the time), but has a fully functioning web-app version that you can use on linux. Supposedly a linux native client is coming \"soon\". It has separate text and voice channels so that you could say, primarily talk via text but can move to a voice channel if desired. It is not somewhat inclusive like slack so anyone can join at any time without a special invite.\n\nBeing really interested in a discord server for ML and seeing none existed, I \"created\" one here with a basic layout and permissions: \nhttps://discord.gg/0t2MLkak0CEEkWKc . \n\nThat being said, it is very easy(and free) to create a discord server. If other people are interested in creating one for ML then more power to them. I'm just interested in there being a discord server for the community.","stickied":false,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/4aeple/discord_server_for_ml/","num_comments":3,"id":"4aeple","distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"created_utc":1457984477,"media_embed":{},"locked":false,"from":null}

In the context of MLP models, what are we trying to achieve?\n\nSupervised learning can also be interpreted as unsupervised learning, depending on the proposed solution. For instance, two sensor + network models might learn to map each other's respective inputs to outputs. The labelling happens naturally as an outcome of co-occurrence. An input from one sensor triggers a response from the other, and so on. Simultaneously occurring experiences are mapped to each other, which leads to unsupervised learning with backprop and so on - unsupervised learning within the supervised paradigm.\n\nBut nonetheless, with backpropagation, we still completely waste the forward pass during training. The two sensors mentioned above learn nothing from their own signals. If a repetitive signal exists in the forward direction, is it really so hard to find it?\n\nThere is a lot of material available to us, for example in fluid dynamics, that we can try to relate to the forward pass in our neural network models. There is a sense that the vector spaces learned in neural network feature extractors could be extracted in the forward pass.\n\nWhen we talk about unsupervised learning in MLP models, is there some clarity that we are trying to exploit the forward pass, and weaken the dependence on the backward pass?","stickied":false,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/4afuqa/we_all_want_unsupervised_learning_but_what_are_we/","num_comments":3,"id":"4afuqa","hide_score":false,"secure_media":null,"from_kind":null,"is_self":true,"thumbnail":"self","saved":false,"over_18":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"media":null,"subreddit":"MachineLearning"}

Volunteer all my time at a computer vision lab.

Or maybe volunteer at a different lab abroad but that can be expensive.\n2. Try to find a work term with a professor, however, I have been told that this is difficult as I am no longer a student and professors usually only have scholarships that they can provide to students.\n3. Work in the industry at a job related to computer vision.\n\nI'm thinking of applying to UofT or one of the top universities in the US.

However, when I ran the optimisation then, it did not train/converge at all.\n\nIs it possible to optimise over this kind of categorical input or can you only optimise over continuous input (like pixel values)?

Also, play around with the temperature bar to see how your results change. Finally, this is not deterministic so the same input can and will give you very different results.

My idea is to run simulations for the complex problem and map the inputs/outputs with a NN. If I generate enough independent points in the model and feed it to the NN it should be able to fit it.\n\nI have good knowledge of my model and I know exactly the 5 inputs that modify the two outputs of the system. The problem is that most points are \"smooth\" and easily predictable and only 5% of them have some weird spikes which is what it is hard to model and I am most interested in predicting with the NN.\n\nFor this reason I thought that to improve the \"spike prediction\" I should feed more spike points to the network by filtering the whole data points and removing points that do not have this property so I leave it to 50% normal points / 50% spike points and so those weird tendencies are better learned.\n\nBesides this what do you suggest as the network structure? To save time I'm using matlab and I'm trying with a simple feedforward network and 3 hidden layers since it seems to give the best results (compared with 1 or 2). It is working well but again the spikes are not that well predicted and I assume it is because of the low % they appear in the data but I'm wondering if another structure would be more appropiate.\n\nThanks for you help.","name":"t3_4aklqy","media_embed":{},"locked":false,"from":null,"gilded":0,"created_utc":1458077842,"distinguished":null,"subreddit":"MachineLearning","thumbnail":"self","is_self":true,"author_flair_css_class":null,"over_18":false,"media":null,"saved":false,"from_kind":null,"secure_media":null,"hide_score":false}

In other words, if you had to star in a late night television infomercial of selling the greatest ml approaches that fall under Bayes, normal, and clustering, what would they be?

But the question is what are the next steps?\n\nI am an undergrad student with a program that has 5 co-op terms, and naturally I need to find the right balance between continuing to learn ML material and actually proving my knowledge  with projects to future employers in my upcoming co-op terms. Yet simultaneously I want to maintain the ability to continue reading on what intrigues me in ML.\n\nWhat do people recommend as the next step? I've found the Deep Learning course by Google Udactiy that I'd love to do. I was hoping to start working on a simple classification problem and then perhaps work my way up to using SVMs with OpenCV afterwards. Lastly, where does one start with reading on papers? I find it hard to find a good place to start.\n\nSorry for the excessive number of questions, but I hope it can just attest to my drive to continue learning!\n\nThanks!","name":"t3_4anq6h","from":null,"locked":false,"media_embed":{},"gilded":0,"created_utc":1458134009,"distinguished":null,"subreddit":"MachineLearning","author_flair_css_class":null,"media":null,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"thumbnail":"self","is_self":true,"from_kind":null,"secure_media":null,"hide_score":false,"author":"IndividualCarnival","subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","edited":false,"quarantine":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"retrieved_on":1463474951,"secure_media_embed":{},"downs":0,"ups":162,"author_flair_text":null,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/4anq6h/age_old_question_the_next_step_after_andrew_ngs/","archived":false,"title":"Age Old Question: The Next Step after Andrew Ng's Course","from_id":null,"link_flair_text":null,"score":162}

But we have yet to see any positive results on our pendulum.\n\n[Here](http://imgur.com/7vF9Mpv) is a picture of the rotary inverted pendulum we built and [a graph](http://imgur.com/a/izCdV) of our latest test, showing the average reward per episode (in green). A computer running python code commutates with an Arduino which in turn controls a stepper motor. We have a rotary encoder which gives us the angle of the pendulum (from which we also calculate the angular velocity). \n\nAs a first step, we have chosen to use Q-learning in a discrete two-dimensional state-space (angular position and velocity). We have let our system run for many hours without any sign of improvement. We have tried varying the parameters of the algorithm, the actions possible, the number of states and their partitioning, etc. \nAlso, our system tends to heat up quite a bit so we have separated the learning into episodes of about 200 steps followed by a brief period of rest. In order to increase speed and precision, we batch update the Q values at the end of each episode. \n\nHere is our update function:\n\n    # Get Q values from database\n    Q_dict = agent.getAllQ()\n    E_dict = {}\n\n    # Set E_dict to 0 for all state-action pairs\n    for s,a in a_StateActionPairs:\n        E_dict[s + a] = 0\n\n    # Q Algorithm\n    # For every step\n    for i_r in episode_record:\n        state, action, new_state, new_action, greedy_action, R = i_r\n\n        # Get Q for current step and calculate target\n        Q = Q_dict[(state, action)]\n        target = R + GAMMA*Q_dict[(new_state,greedy_action)]\n        \n        # Update E for visited state\n        E_dict[(state, action)] += 1\n\n        # Update Q for every state-action pair\n        for s,a in a_StateActionPairs:\n            updatedQ = Q_dict[(s,a)]+ALPHA*E_dict[(s,a)]*(target-Q)\n            Q_dict[(s,a)] = updatedQ\n            # Set E to 0 if new_action was chosen at random (epsilon-greedy)\n            if greedy_action == new_action:\n                E_dict[(s,a)] *= GAMMA*LAMBDA\n            else: \n                E_dict[(s,a)] = 0\n\n    # Update database\n    agent.setAllQ(Q_dict)\n    log.info('Qvalues updated')\n\nHere is \"main\" part of the code: Github (https://github.com/Blabby/inverted-pendulum/blob/master/QAlgo.py)\n\nHere our some of our hypothesis as to why are tests are unsuccessful:\n- The system has not run for a long enough time\n- Our exploration (e-greedy) in not adapted to the problem\n- The hyper-parameters are not optimized\n- Our physical system is too unpredictable \n\nDoes anyone have any experience applying reinforcement learning to physical systems? We have hit a roadblock and are looking for help and/or ideas.","from_kind":null,"preview":{"images":[{"source":{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/Uw7xd_sGF9nTAJIAiZy51uQJcOvUoB8wi6hP63AxtH8.jpg?s=5fd83cc49079772e325f8a3de3c125de","height":1370,"width":1028},"variants":{},"id":"FRiE9KyFt9vcx7EXrh3zEymtnq47KxiR32S60C_tLPs","resolutions":[{"width":108,"height":143,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/Uw7xd_sGF9nTAJIAiZy51uQJcOvUoB8wi6hP63AxtH8.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=68b42d847bea8e8dc9ce3b71c3f4808e"},{"width":216,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/Uw7xd_sGF9nTAJIAiZy51uQJcOvUoB8wi6hP63AxtH8.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=9753e65976015ac9036313bbf82044bd","height":287},{"width":320,"height":426,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/Uw7xd_sGF9nTAJIAiZy51uQJcOvUoB8wi6hP63AxtH8.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=4784bfec8fdc6850275294584f57f864"},{"width":640,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/Uw7xd_sGF9nTAJIAiZy51uQJcOvUoB8wi6hP63AxtH8.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;s=cb016f0b94c0d420fe7e102c311729e0","height":852},{"height":1279,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/Uw7xd_sGF9nTAJIAiZy51uQJcOvUoB8wi6hP63AxtH8.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=960&amp;s=9cfbc565eeb0762e655ea82a7414602b","width":960}]}]},"hide_score":false,"secure_media":null,"subreddit":"MachineLearning","saved":false,"media":null,"over_18":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"is_self":true,"thumbnail":"self","link_flair_css_class":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"retrieved_on":1463475319,"downs":0,"post_hint":"self","author":"l_bdcdb","subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","edited":false,"quarantine":false,"link_flair_text":null,"score":10,"ups":10,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","author_flair_text":null,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/4aoikb/physical_application_of_qlearning_to_rotary/","archived":false,"title":"Physical application of Q-learning to rotary inverted pendulum","from_id":null}

I need to use a very neutered version of R with no external libraries and with many of the good internal libraries not working as well.  Many of the optimizer libraries you're likely to suggest that I use I have already tried and they won't load.  However, the optimize() function from the stats library is something that I can use.  \n\nSo that's the context.  I want to do L1 regularization with a very basic optimization package.  This optimization package has a small number of methods I can use, like Conjugate Gradients, BFGS, L-BFGS, etc.  Some of these methods require me to pass a gradient function as well as the function itself.  I'm looking for speed, so I'd like to pass a gradient function so that the solver doesn't have to waste time on numerical gradient approximations.  \n\nQuestion:\n\nAs we all know, the L1 penalty of sum |weights| is non-differentiable at zero. \n\nI was wondering if I could define the L1 gradient as follows:\n\n    gradient wrt weight_i = sign(weight_i) if weight_i is not 0\n                           = 0             if weight_i = 0\n\n\nIt's an obvious fix, but I never hear anyone talking about it, so I'm wondering how dangerous this is?  The plan is to write out a function for L1-penalized sum-square error and function of its gradient with the tweak I mentioned above.  Then I will pass that function and the gradient function to the solver and hope that a correct sparse solution pops out.\n\nUPDATE - thanks for the quick and informative replies, folks!

I've just finished a stint at a startup in SF and after moving around in several departments I've realized data science is what I want to do. Before working at a startup I was in college part way through my sophomore credits before I dropped out to work for this startup. Now I want to go back for a degree but want to pivot out of marketing and into stats/CS degree for undergrad. Ultimately I want to pursue a graduate degree (PhD maybe) in Computational Science. I wanna do lab research or possibly high level industry work as a data science lead or R&amp;amp;D.\n\n\nI'm debating about getting an associates degree or two at a community college to save on money and in theory have a better developed resume for internships in DS / undergrad research experience in my region. I say two because at the institution I'm looking at I can get an A.S. in Information Systems which will give me CS1010 and CS1020 as well as supporting course work in SAS and SQL which I feel will be useful technical skills to have under my belt. The second degree would be in mathematics and would be for the sole purpose of having the degree title on my resume as well and getting math credits for cheaper. I've also considered getting a single A.S. in general engineering and doing a double major in CS and Stats to diversify my credentials. I feel like double majoring in stats and CS after having 2 A.S degrees in math and information systems provides no benefit besides possibly giving me an edge applying for research internships / undergrad research experience in my Sophomore and Junior year.\n\n\nIn summary, how would 2 A.S. degrees in information systems and mathematics look on an interns resume while they were essentially perusing the same two degrees at a 4 year institution, compared to someone who has a single A.S. in General engineering who appears to be pivoting away from it and into a data science role with a double major in stats and computer science?\n\n\nPlease, no pulled punches here. Any and all criticism is welcome. I'm trying to make a pretty serious decision and don't want to waste my time or leave any value on the table by making an ill-informed decision.\n\nThanks -- an_tsu\n","from":null,"media_embed":{},"locked":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"created_utc":1458187352,"subreddit":"MachineLearning","saved":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"over_18":false,"media":null,"is_self":true,"thumbnail":"self","from_kind":null,"hide_score":false,"secure_media":null}

I am under the impression they project the phrase to an 8000x1 dimensional vector, but if you look at an example like this: http://image.slidesharecdn.com/l07nnrnngrulstm-151108140716-lva1-app6892/95/recurrent-neural-networks-lstm-and-gru-33-638.jpg?cb=1446992496\nI don't see where an LSTM would be able to transform the vector to a different dimension.  That's why I'm assuming there is a feedforward layer on top of the LSTM because if you look at h(t-1), it has to be fed back into the LSTM with the same dimensional size as x(t) so they can be added together.  So if the LSTM was outputting something of different size than the input vector, they wouldn't be able to be added.  Is that more clear?","name":"t3_4aw3i0","id":"4aw3i0","num_comments":14,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/4aw3i0/how_do_rnns_handle_providing_output_with/","stickied":false,"gilded":0,"created_utc":1458262977,"distinguished":null,"from":null,"media_embed":{},"locked":false}
{"selftext":"I am trying to understand whether NN can do and/or/xor in general. Suppose the input x = (x_1, x_2) is a 2d real vector, and NN is asked to produce y = (x_1&gt;a) OP (x_2&gt;b), here OP is one of the logic gates. From experiments I found that the trained NN can do well for test samples that are not too \"different\" from training samples (assuming x_1, x_2 are sampled uniformly from [-10, 10]), but once that's not met (e.g. x_1 = 10, x2 = 10000), then it is possible the trained NN will produce wrong results. Since it is not possible to generate training samples with arbitrary large values, but the trained NN should generalize to arbitrary large values that it haven't seen before. So I wonder is there a proof or theory to show NN can handle logic gates like above for unconstrained real inputs?","name":"t3_4awt3w","permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/4awt3w/do_neural_networks_know_logic_gates/","stickied":false,"id":"4awt3w","num_comments":25,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"created_utc":1458274747,"media_embed":{},"locked":false,"from":null,"thumbnail":"self","is_self":true,"over_18":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"media":null,"saved":false,"subreddit":"MachineLearning","secure_media":null,"hide_score":false,"from_kind":null,"quarantine":false,"edited":1458310333,"author":"yield22","subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","downs":0,"retrieved_on":1463479258,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_css_class":null,"from_id":null,"title":"Do neural networks know logic gates?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/4awt3w/do_neural_networks_know_logic_gates/","archived":false,"author_flair_text":null,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","ups":2,"score":2,"link_flair_text":null}

Example:\n\nState 34 has Q-value of 5.  You look at every state you can get to from State 34, and see that the one with the highest Q-Value has a value of 6.  So using your *alpha* value and your *discount* value you update State 34 to have a Q-value of, say, 5.7.\n\nHOWEVER.  You do NOT back-propagate those values back from State 34 to State 33 to State 32 ... to State 0.  Instead, you simply let future simulations reach State 33, which expands to State 34, then updates its own value.  So to successfully propagate that information all the way back to State 0, you need to run at least 34 simulations/iterations, and each time that information gets one state \"closer\" to State 0.\n\nHopefully this makes sense so far (cause I'm new to this so I might be mistaken).  But say you are trying to apply this to the state-space of Reversi (Othello).  That's a lot of states.\n\nWouldn't it make more sense to back-propagate *immediately and explicetly?*  That is, the moment State 34 updates its Q-value estimate based off what it sees in State 35, you push recursively push those updates back to State 33, 32, 31 ... 0.\n\nThis takes more work, but at least the information you learned way up in State 35 propagates back to the beginning, without fail?  Iterations may take longer, but their information is always useful?\n\nMy fear is that if I do Q-learning the \"right\" way, which apparently doesn't back-propagate explicitly, I might reach states very far into a game on one iteration, but then never happen to visit those states again in future iterations.  So their values are essentially lost in space, since we never \"attach\" to them to push them back.\n\nHope all that made sense.  I might just be totally confused.  Please let me know!

I have a coursework assignment to implement Newton's method of MLP training and compare it to standard first-order training. I need to implement Newton's method with both approximate and exact Hessian, and also compare the performance of the two.\n\nI want to do this in Python. I'm aware that nobody really uses this training method anymore, so I'm not worried about \"learning it properly\". Also, I have other, more important work to do, and I have almost no experience implementing more advanced neural nets outside of the comfort of Theano/Keras and tensorflow. So I'm willing to use a library or two to speed up the process, even though I'm supposed to hand-code everything. However, I can't use anything too high-level, as the lecturer would probably kick me straight out of the course.\n\n**TL;DR from here:** I have until Tuesday to implement Newton's method with approx Hessian &amp; exact Hessian. What's the *absolutely easiest way* to do this in Python, potentially using a framework but not something that makes it a two-line script?\n\nP.S. any code examples for inspiration are welcome.\n\nThanks a lot!\n\n","name":"t3_4axqpw","locked":false,"media_embed":{},"from":null,"distinguished":null,"created_utc":1458298042,"gilded":0,"author_flair_text":null,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","ups":2,"from_id":null,"title":"[advice] Need to implement Newton's method optimization for a MLP in Python.

I'm taking machine learning and it feels like a bunch of math with no intuition was just thrown at me.\n\nFirst week, professor throws a bunch of entropy equations at us, I have no clue what entropy even means, I don't know what all the equation means, what is \"regression\" or \"information gain\". I've never taken information theory before. Before I had time to digest it, we are moving to decision trees and neural networks. Those two feel more intuitive but still a lot of entropy equations to check for errors or something.\n\nBasically, I was expecting a course focused on algorithms, but I got a bunch of entropy equations and error checking thrown at me. \n\nI'm currently reading on Support Vector Machines before the next lecture. I get what the margin is, I get what dot product and length means. But then the textbook throws me [this whole new equation](http://i.imgur.com/7uFsj2t.png) to check the error, and I don't get it...

{"name":"t3_4bhmqb","selftext":"Is there anyone working on either a decentralized deep learning algorithm, or a consumer facing app that uses AI to help people diagnose themselves?\n\nMy wife was just diagnosed with CVID a couple of weeks ago, it's like AIDS except it's not Aquired, it's part genetic and part environmental - but it's a rare primary immunodeficiency disease.\n\nShe's had this her entire life. She's 33 years old, a wonderful mother to our 5 year old daughter, and beautiful singer, actor and writer. She was misdiagnosed 3 or 4 times, most recently she was eating gluten free for the last 8 years because she was diagnosed as celiac disease.\n\nShe's lost most of her hair over the last 6 months and has been in the hospital 3-4 times this year. It turns out, she never had celiac, she has always had CVID.\n\n**Where Deep Learning fits in.**\nMy wife should have been diagnosed in her childhood years, in fact, all it would have taken was a simple blood test to measure her antibody levels, and an Immunologist appointment.\n\nWith all of her symptoms, her medications and blood test results - a deep learning algorithm would have been able to suggest a proper diagnosis in a few minutes instead of the 30 years that it took for her to get properly diagnosed by just letting doctors do their thing.\n\n\n**The problem with diagnosing rare diseases:** \nCVID affects 1 in 25,000 - 50,000 people, it's a rare disease where patients present with a myriad of symptoms and autoimmune problems. It's hard to get a correct diagnosis because a patient typically sees many different doctors to treat the different types of symptoms, and they don\u2019t typically share information efficiently - nor do they have an incentive to properly diagnose her.\n\nThere should be a visually appealing, easily marketable app that combines machine learning and crowdsourced input from app users to give the \"hot/cold\" direction that will greatly improve time to diagnose these \"zebra\" cases.\n\nThe average lag time for CVID diagnosis is 6-7 years. This is common with most rare diseases. If my wife was diagnosed even 2 years ago, she would not have lost all of her hair.\n\nThe treatment for my wife\u2019s condition is IVIG every 2-4 weeks, and it greatly improves quality of life and life expectancy. The earlier a rare disease is diagnosed, the better the quality of life.\n\n**The problem with doctor-facing AI solutions:**\nI see that there are some machine learning startups, but they are mostly targeted towards health professionals. There\u2019s resistance from doctors to adopt AI. \n\nThe problem is that this technology needs to be available for the patient, not just doctors, and not just specialists at John Hopkins or the Mayo Clinic.\n\nNobody is going to be as motivated and investing in someone's health as the person and their loved ones. Quite often, patients with diseases become more knowledgeable than the specialists treating them for the disease.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of knowledge to be tapped into there from the 'zebras' themselves.\n\n**Potential barriers to a centralized organization providing this solution:**\nThe FDA and drug companies are resistant to technologies that allow users to diagnose themselves. 23andme ran into issues with this. They just finally got FDA approval in October to start helping people agian (http://www.popsci.com/23andme-gets-fda-approval-for-direct-to-consumer-genetic-tests)\n\n\n**Some existing projects:**\nA friend who sold his company to Salesforce for 70 million dollars introduced me to this TED talk shortly after my wife was diagnosed, where Jeremy Howard explains how deep learning works, and it\u2019s potential applications:\nhttps://www.ted.com/talks/jeremy_howard_the_wonderful_and_terrifying_implications_of_computers_that_can_learn?language=en\n\n^Jeremy's company Enlitic is using deep learning to help doctors come to a proper diagnosis faster, currently only focusing on radiology. Again, it's just doctor-facing.\n\nwww.findzebra.com is a search engine that you can input your symptoms, it uses something similar to deep learning to suggest possible health issues, but it doesn\u2019t use AI. It crawls and indexes only curated medical sources.\n\nJeremy Gardner &amp; the Augur guys introduced me to www.crowdmed.com which is a great solution for diagnosing rare diseases, but costly.\n\nCrowdMed is a site where you tell your story, and then it uses crowdsourced knowledge to come to diagnosis suggestions. You pay a monthly fee of $299 - $749 a month, and then \u201cmedical detectives\u201d investigate for you, and their predictive market algorithm ranks what the detectives submit.\n\nVitalik Buterin of Ethereum told me about www.numer.ai which is a competition that uses homomorphically encrypted machine learning to let people try to predict the stock market. It\u2019s a way to anonymize data, to alleviate some concerns about people\u2019s medical data being publicly available.\n\nXprize even has a $5 million dollar prize up with IBM Watson for AI http://www.xprize.org/ai\n\nThere's also openai.com, with names like Elon Musk &amp; Sam Altman attached, it's a non-for-profit with a billion dollars committed, but they haven't yet released what their focus is.\n\n**Potential solution to being blocked by FDA etc:**\nDecentralized deep learning on a blockchain, where users are rewarded tokens for providing the hot/cold and running the network. Think ethereum, bitcoin, etc.\n\nIn my limited understanding of machine learning, it seems that for a deep learning algorithm to learn, humans need to give it hot/cold inputs to the correlations it comes up with as it compares datasets (Jeremy\u2019s ted talk video explains that)\n\nMy theory is that a decentralized deep learning algorithm on a blockchain could be built where the people giving hot/cold inputs are awarded with a token for doing the mechanical turk style work. When consensus is achieved, the people who were correct get rewarded. Similar to how Augur\u2019s reporting system works, or bitcoin\u2019s proof of work.\n\nIf users are rewarded for giving correct hot/cold inputs to help the deep learning AI learn about subjects, there\u2019s a financial incentive to keep the network running.\n\nCompanies, individuals, universities, etc could tap into the algorithm to use it for whatever purpose they want - and they would pay to use it.\n\nIE I want to build an application that uses deep learning to help diagnose rare diseases so people like my wife don\u2019t have to suffer going undiagnosed and untreated their entire lives.

In particular, I am planning to use \"transfer learning\" to recognize a single type of object. \n\n**Project objective:** using a USB camera and software running on a laptop, recognize and mark (i.e. draw a box around) any **handicap buttons**. You know, these things: \n\nhttp://recyclenation.com/resources/2015/3/handicap%20buttons.jpg\nhttp://jimlindlauf.areavoices.com/files/2011/12/Handicap-door-opener.jpg\nhttps://purpleletters.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/hand.jpg\nhttp://clinicalposters.com/img/photo/handicap_button.jpg\n\nI learned about transfer learning here: http://cs231n.github.io/transfer-learning/ My understanding is that by using features obtained by training on the imagenet database, I can create something simple like a support vector machine to classify the object. \n\n**Datasets:**\n\n- Positive dataset: since my project only needs to work on a few real-life buttons, I was planning on taking videos with my camera of the door buttons. Maybe a few thousand frames, zooming in and out and rotating the phone to get a more varied dataset. \n\n- Negative dataset: ? Not sure what sort of data I should train on for \"not handicap door button\". I could definitely use some advice here. How large should this dataset be? What should it consist of?\n\n**Proposed process:**\n\n- Collect datasets of positive (is button) and negative (is not button) examples through photo/video. Resize and downsample as appropriate. \n\n- Use deep learning software library Caffe (highly recommended according to my web searches) with a pre-trained imagenet model. I can get the features with a forward pass of an image through the network (after vectorizing the output of last conv layer), which should give me e.g. a 4096-D vector.\n\n- Use these image code feature vectors to train an SVM on my dataset.\n\n- Use OpenCV to draw a box around the region with the highest model activations once the software detects the image frame has a handicap button in it (unclear on specifics of this, but I'm sure it's possible).\n\nDoes this sound reasonable? What extra steps or modifications would you make to my plan? \n\nThank you very much for any insight or advice!

It is made up of 650M real user search queries bucketed into 25 vertical categories (Auto, Health, Finance, etc.) containing roughly 450K sub-categories.  \n\nIt's a rule-based system, and we use NLP and nGram chunking to parse long and short form text and map search queries, social posts, web content, blogs, forums, reviews, etc. to the category hierarchy providing structured, topical intelligence to data streams at scale.  It is extremely accurate because we've built 55M controlled vocabularies (Ex. rules determine the difference between bowtie pasta &amp; bowtie gift wrapping).\n\nBeing the noob I am, I am trying to understand how our real time classification capabilities can improve the efficiency of machine learned processes.  I understand that supervised training models require a corpus of text from which a model can determine entities, ontological connections, and apply statistical models to understand what people, places, things, concepts are and how they may be connected, but we've already built out the taxonomy to understand connections between things, and can provide greater context to \"what\" something truly is.  For example, you have a corpus of text containing different types of vehicles - Pick up truck, Ford F150, Toyota Camry, Jetski, bicycle, helicopter, accord, etc.  eContext would map each of those to a category resulting in a list of concepts, but further, provide the context automatically by recognizing that all of these things fall into the \"Vehicles\" category.  Accord, Toyota Camry, Ford F150, and pick up truck all fall under the Vehicles::Automotive Vehicles branch (implies the connection there), and further Accord and Toyota Camry both fall into a child of Automotive, that being \"sedans\" - Vehicles::Automotive Vehicles::Sedans\n\nSo, the question is, where can this be applied in building ML models to improve efficiency.  I see this being the most useful when you're looking at a sloppy corpus, like social media posts, or content streams from the web with an extremely varied topical distribution, but I'm sure there are more pointed applications as well.  \n\nI've also heard there may be value of this type of classification in auto-Annotation for Text Analytics, but any other suggestions or perspectives would be appreciated!!\n\nI would love the opportunity to work with any of you to develop a hypothesis around the capabilities of a universal taxonomy in improving the efficiency and efficacy of ML processes.  I look forward to learning more.\n\nClassification Examples\nhttp://imgur.com/B4yr0bg - We've taken the last 488 posts that @realDonaldTrump has posted to Twitter, parsed, and mapped to the category hierarchy for a top level, categorical view of his activity - each color represents a different vertical, so tan=government, yellow=arts &amp; entertainment, green=finance, etc.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/2bdXE2P - Article - Content Classification example - notice the category paths provided, which I think could be a feature or quality to clarify the context of entities/annotations","num_comments":6,"id":"4biyad","stickied":false,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/4biyad/text_classification_via_universal_taxonomy/","preview":{"images":[{"resolutions":[{"height":56,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/gBjtktbuikQ-HmiT5IYwLHBnmuISgdX7bsRYHOc8Z_U.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=49e41c8958d584fefefdb6765c9f5c06","width":108},{"width":216,"height":112,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/gBjtktbuikQ-HmiT5IYwLHBnmuISgdX7bsRYHOc8Z_U.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=d0e4197e50bc40ea92b6a431f6f75b60"},{"height":167,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/gBjtktbuikQ-HmiT5IYwLHBnmuISgdX7bsRYHOc8Z_U.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=45ad24225cb098d491b00d8be99c42d5","width":320},{"width":640,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/gBjtktbuikQ-HmiT5IYwLHBnmuISgdX7bsRYHOc8Z_U.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;s=ed4ecb7cab66e9dec01165e9c8f20656","height":334},{"width":960,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/gBjtktbuikQ-HmiT5IYwLHBnmuISgdX7bsRYHOc8Z_U.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=960&amp;s=20d8f58a29e2ad6f928e67a012351d59","height":502},{"width":1080,"height":564,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/gBjtktbuikQ-HmiT5IYwLHBnmuISgdX7bsRYHOc8Z_U.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=1080&amp;s=a5094206ab6b6f75093aea7893113697"}],"variants":{},"id":"UQ-tyYvE19R2JHFk2W70l5R1R_SgBTLazO9o6PnzEu0","source":{"width":1858,"height":972,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/gBjtktbuikQ-HmiT5IYwLHBnmuISgdX7bsRYHOc8Z_U.jpg?s=9efa7cd775cc2b0e60d2665a4689f1e8"}}]},"hide_score":false,"secure_media":null,"from_kind":null,"saved":false,"media":null,"over_18":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"is_self":true,"thumbnail":"self","subreddit":"MachineLearning"}

Currently I am a final year (graduation year) CS student who got interested in machine learning about 6 months ago.

I didn't pay attention to the specialization at that moment. \nBut recently I got an email from Quora about an AMA session from Carlros Guestrin (https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-ways-to-learn-advanced-Machine-Learning-outside-academia/answer/Carlos-Guestrin?srid=Cqnv). In this AMA he suggested that if you'd like to learn more about machine learning one of the things you could do was to follow and complete the Coursera course from Andrew NG and their specialization course. \n\nSo now I am wondering if the course (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning) is worth the money? Has anyone followed this course and did you enjoy it?\n\nThanks a lot for taking the time to read it :)\n\n","name":"t3_4bj4fv","permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/4bj4fv/is_the_machine_learning_specialization_on/","stickied":false,"id":"4bj4fv","num_comments":11,"score":0,"link_flair_text":null,"from_id":null,"archived":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/4bj4fv/is_the_machine_learning_specialization_on/","title":"Is the machine learning specialization on Coursera from the Washington university worth the money?","author_flair_text":null,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","ups":0,"post_hint":"self","downs":0,"retrieved_on":1463489879,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_css_class":null,"quarantine":false,"edited":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","author":"Akatchi"}

{"selftext":"Hi all - I'm seeking advice on how to best learn the math required for doing machine learning research, particularly with regard to neural nets (and other graphical models - sorry if I'm using these terms incorrectly).  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMy background is in cognitive science, but of a particularly computational flavor, so I've been exposed to the high level ideas behind \"connectionist\" models, and have used them as a sort of black box in the context of comparing their performance to human behavioral data. But my undergrad coursework is conspicuously lacking in math.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI recently got a job as a software engineer in a lab that works on deep learning (in NLP applications), and I want to be able to understand the math well enough to contribute to research. The lab PI and I have discussed my interest in eventually converting to a grad student, so I want to make sure my math abilities are solid as soon as I can.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo here's my question: should I start learning from the bottom up (e.g. by taking courses in multivariable calc, linear algebra, and stats), or from the top down (learn what I can from papers on the topics the lab is working on at a high level, and when I don't have the math background for a particular topic, go back and learn the math needed)?  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOther suggestions are also welcome.

My employer eContext, has curated a general taxonomy that encompasses everything commercially and socially relevant on the web. It consists of 650M real user search queries bucketed into 25 vertical categories (Auto, Health, Finance, etc.) containing roughly 450K sub-categories.\nIt's a rule-based system, and we use NLP and nGram chunking to parse long and short form text and map search queries, social posts, web content, blogs, forums, etc. to the category hierarchy providing structured, topical intelligence to data streams at scale. It is wildly accurate due to 55M controlled vocabularies \n\nGOAL: To understand how classification to a fixed hierarchy of topics can improve the efficiency of machine learned and predictive model building\n\nI understand that supervised training models require a corpus of text from which a model can determine entities, ontological connections, and apply statistical models to understand what people, places, things, concepts are and how they may be connected. That said, we've already built out the taxonomy to understand those connections and can provide greater context to \"what\" something truly is. \n\nFor example, you have a corpus of text containing different types of vehicles - Pick up truck, Ford F150, Toyota Camry, Jetski, bicycle, helicopter, accord, etc. eContext would map each of those to a category resulting in a list of concepts, but further, provide the context automatically by recognizing that all of these things fall into the \"Vehicles\" category.

I think it's happening now, but wait until there is 0 people with a clue.\n\n&gt; This sub is fairly small and not that active, so it's not particularly difficult to find \"serious\" content.\n\nThe problem is demographic, IMO. I don't even feel like replying with *thoughtful comments* oftentimes, because I know that something idiotic will get more upvotes, and my comment might even get downvoted, unless it's 100% agreeable to the vast majority of noobs. I know that many others feel the same way.\n\n*PROPOSED SOLUTIONS:*\n\n**OPTION 1 (requires little moderation)**\n\nAdd a permanent sticky encouraging noobs to go to /r/datascience \"No need to study or think. Everyone welcome\". There is already some activity there, so it might work.\n\nI believe Geoff Hinton referred to the whole field of Data Science as being pseudo-intellectual. I forget the exact quote, but it's from a lecture or talk online. For reasons I cannot comprehend, noobs tend to hate Hinton (\"too arrogant\" - idiots).  We should find his exact quote, and mention  it in the sticky. They'll go to /r/datascience simply out of spite.\n\n**OPTION 2 (changes the character of the sub rather drastically, but also requires little moderation)**\n\nA bot like in /r/statML to fill this sub with arxiv papers. Unlike /r/statML, other content should be allowed. I believe that most arxiv submissions are not worth reading, but this is what the voting system is for.\n\n**OPTION 3 (requires a lot of effort to moderate, might be infeasible)**\n\nA new heavily moderated sub in the spirit of /r/askcience or /r/science, permanently sticked from this sub, unlike previous efforts.\n\nThese 3 options can be combined.\n","from":null,"media_embed":{},"locked":false,"created_utc":1458797854,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"subreddit":"MachineLearning","saved":false,"media":null,"over_18":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"is_self":true,"thumbnail":"self","from_kind":null,"hide_score":false,"secure_media":null,"author":"[deleted]","subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","edited":1458897424,"quarantine":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"retrieved_on":1463493350,"downs":0,"ups":12,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","author_flair_text":null,"title":"[META] Should this sub be split in two?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/4bqeuh/meta_should_this_sub_be_split_in_two/","archived":false,"from_id":null,"link_flair_text":null,"score":12}

Unfortunately, it left out some details. I'm hoping someone is familiar and can advise me on writing an implementation in Python.\n\n###Quick Background\n\nSequential Agglomerative Hierarchical Non-overlapping (SAHN) clustering is the type of clustering that SciPy's [scipy.cluster.hierarchy](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/cluster.hierarchy.html) and R's [hclust](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/hclust.html) implement.\n\nSuppose you start with N objects that can be grouped together into clusters. The SAHN clustering procedure starts off with everything as its own cluster and, at each iteration, combines two clusters into one. It does this N-1 times until the N objects go from being in N groups of 1 object to 1 group of N objects.\n\nAlong the way, it builds up a tree structure called a [dendrogram](http://www.statistics4u.com/fundstat_eng/img/hl_dendrogram.png). Every node in the dendrogram represents a combination of two clusters. Thus, the dendrogram compactly represents choices for every possible number of clusters from 1 to N. This is useful because in many applications, the number of clusters is not known ahead of time.\n\n### Podani's Extension\n\nBoth scipy.cluster.hierarchy and hclust come with roughly the same methods for choosing which clusters to combine at each stage. This is because each of their included methods can be implemented with recurrence relations of the same form.\n\nIn this paper, [Podani1989b](http://ramet.elte.hu/~podani/Podani_NewCombClustering_Vegetatio_1989a.pdf), Podani (Hungarian biologist) extended that general recurrence relation by adding a few more terms. In doing so, he opened the door for several more clustering methods. Further, he clarified the rational behind each of the previous methods (as well as clearing up some confusion about what Ward's method is actually doing; spoiler: it doesn't minimize variance).\n\nThese other methods look promising and I'm interested in experimenting with them in my own application. However, the paper fails to precisely define his added terms: w_i, w_j, w_h. They can apparently take one of four forms depending on the particular method: SSQ, VAR, SIM, DIS. However, these forms are not adequately defined.\n\nPodani also has an [online resource](http://ramet.elte.hu/~podani/subindex.html), written several years later, which goes into more detail. There is much more in that resource, but the relevant parts are:\n\n* [Chapter 3](http://ramet.elte.hu/~podani/3-Distance,%20similarity.pdf) which defines the many forms of DIS that are possible, and summarizes SSQ, VAR, and DIS (called AVG) on page 100.\n\n* [Chapter 5, section 5.2](http://ramet.elte.hu/~podani/5-Hierarchical%20clustering.pdf) (beginning on page 139) which summarizes SAHN clustering. Table 5.1 (page 143) summarizes the old methods. Table 5.2 (page 150) summarizes some of the new ones.\n\nDespite this, it's still unclear how to calculate these terms at each stage of the dendrogram construction. Or even what the terms are _exactly_. The scale factors 1/2 and 1/4 in the seed distances indicate that SSQ and VAR may also need to be scaled.\n\n### My Questions\n\nIs anyone familiar with this work? I'm working on an implementation in Python and I'd love experiment with the methods it describes.\n\nIs there perhaps an open source implementation somewhere? I was unable to find one.\n\nThanks in advance!","name":"t3_4bsb7a"}

I hope some of you can take the time to read through this post. It'd definitely help me, and I'll give half a bitcoin (about $200) to whoever makes the best suggestion on what area to explore next to make my data behave even better. So one if you is getting a nice night on the town on me :-) (if that helps any, alternatively I can donate to your favorite charity in your name). I'll decide on the winner a week after this post goes live.\n\n**The problem**\n\nI'm doing machine learning with scikit-learn in python 2.7. It's a regression problem with about 100 features (all 'floats', no classes) *some of which are actually someone else's best guess for the target*. I'll refer to these as 'the others'. There are around 20k samples.\n\n**What I've done so far**\n\n* Cleaning up data - Removed outliers, imputed values that were missing by averaging over similar samples.\n\n* Linear regression - Didn't perform any better than other peoples guesses for the target.\n\n* Ridge regression - With alpha (some people call this lambda) set by leave-one-out crossvalidation. Best so far, about a 1% improvement over the others' on the test set.\n\n* Added polynomial features - 2nd degree. This actually performs worse (we now have around 10k features) than ridge regression without these features.\n\n* FANN Neural net - Performs around 5% worse than Ridge (I tried several different NN configurations, 1-3 hidden layers with .5 to 2x the amount of features as nodes, and overnight learning)\n\n**What I'm looking for**\n\n* Answers to the questions:\n\n1. Is there a way to establish when you've reached the maximum potential for learning from a dataset? My gut feeling says that when the targets are normally distributed around your predictions, you're getting close. But there can *always* be a better predictor that has a normal distribution as well, with a smaller standard deviation?\n       \n2. My main interest is predicting a specific subset of my samples as well as possible. If I only use them for regression, the predictor actually performs worse than when I include the whole dataset when learning (by quite a wide margin). 'Whaddupwitdat?' :-)\n\n* MAIN GOAL: Suggestions on how to proceed. Anything helps, but better performance on the test set is the number one priority. Speed is not essential, nor is computational efficiency (I can wait). Ease of implementation helps.\n\nThanks for reading this. I appreciate any comments!\n\n\nJohn\n\n**EDIT**: I'm already normalizing the features where relevant","from_kind":null,"hide_score":false,"secure_media":null,"subreddit":"MachineLearning","saved":false,"over_18":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"media":null,"is_self":true,"thumbnail":"self"}

For reference, X is a  1080x5 array, and there are less than 25 NaNs in each column of the array. \n\nThanks!","name":"t3_4bsqke","from":null,"media_embed":{},"locked":false,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"created_utc":1458842587,"ups":0,"author_flair_text":null,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/4bsqke/dealing_with_nan_in_dataset/","archived":false,"title":"Dealing with NaN in dataset?","from_id":null,"link_flair_text":null,"score":0,"author":"Gay_Hat_On_Nun","subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","edited":false,"quarantine":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"retrieved_on":1463494509,"secure_media_embed":{},"downs":0}

I arrived at time-series analysis models that seemed to be suited to the task, but I'm hitting some issues I would appreciate some help with. I haven't really done any ML on timeseries data or autoregression so this is kind of new to me.\n\nFirst of all, the nature of my data is dense measurements of a particular value over time. Minute frequency. The seasonality of the data is probably both weekly and daily.  \n\nWhen looking for timeseries models for seasonal data, nearly all the sources suggested a SARIMA model. But when trying to actually use one, I discovered that the seasonalities are usually in the order of 6 or 12 lags (monthly financial data).  The python statsmodels implementation of SARIMA straight up goes out of memory (daily seasonality is 1440 when dealing with minute data), and the X13 implementation doesn't even accept non-monthly data.\n\nI then tried some non seasonal ARIMA models just to PoC the implementation and found out that the predictions flatline after a number of steps, which either means my model was overfitting on the available data, or that i should have been updating the model per new measurement, or both? \n\nAm I even on the right path or is there a different ML technique more suited to the problem?","num_comments":3,"id":"4bwug8","stickied":false,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/4bwug8/time_series_analysis_help/","distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"created_utc":1458918741,"from":null,"media_embed":{},"locked":false,"archived":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/4bwug8/time_series_analysis_help/","title":"Time series analysis help","from_id":null,"ups":0,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","author_flair_text":null,"link_flair_text":null,"score":0,"quarantine":false,"author":"swamp_zero","subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","edited":false,"downs":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"retrieved_on":1463496422}

I am currently attempting to set up tensorflow through docker but am having some troubles getting to the jupyter notebook once it appears to be running. For future reference, I am using windows 10, powershell, python 2.7, and oracle virtualbox (v.5.0.16).\n\n\nI am pretty confident that docker is working properly because I went through their setup tutorial [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/windows/) (\"Using docker from Powershell\") without any issues--I was able to run the hello world example there just fine. I was also able to successfully run an ubuntu terminal with the command \n\n    docker run -it ubuntu bash\n I then followed the [tensorflow docker installation instructions](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.7/get_started/os_setup.html#test-the-tensorflow-installation) and everything appeared to be normal--I entered the docker run command for tensorflow:\n\n      docker run -it b.gcr.io/tensorflow/tensorflow\n\n\n and got [this output](http://imgur.com/7vnZgqW). \nHowever, when I attempt to get to the jupyter notebook at http://localhost:8888, chrome says the site cannot be reached within a few seconds and that the server refused to connect.\n\n**Solutions I have tried:**\n\n* Followed the advice in [this stackoverflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33636925/how-do-i-start-tensorflow-docker-jupyter-notebook). When I run the command they suggest to start a new tensorflow container, I get the error: \n\n    *exec: \"./run_jupyter.sh\": stat ./run_jupyter.sh: no such file or directory\ndocker: Error response from daemon: Container command not found or does not exist..*\n\n I also changed the port settings using virtualbox like they suggested, and this also did not seem to make a difference. \n\n* Instead of going to localhost, I tried the IP addresses listed for the driver when I use the command *docker-machine ls*. No luck here either.\n\n* My first attempt was using the quickstart terminal that comes with docker, and I got stuck in the same place. So now I have a \"default\", from when I set up docker using the quickstart terminal, and a \"my-default\", from when I set up docker using powershell. Stackexchange comments have said that the quickstart terminal doesn't work as well as just using powershell, so I have started using powershell instead. \n\n* Tried changing which driver was active using *docker-machine env* and then running the tensorflow run command for that driver's IP address, and still had no luck. \n\n* Tried skipping the jupyter notebook and just running everything from the command line through python [as suggested in the next step of the tensorflow install](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.7/get_started/os_setup.html#test-the-tensorflow-installation) (\"Run tensorflow from the command line\") and I could not even import tensorflow from there ([see error here](http://imgur.com/1v0jA7Z)). I don't know if this is possible without running jupyter first but I thought it was worth a shot. This problem might be unrelated to the one this post is about, but if anyone has an idea as to why this is, that would be helpful too. \n\nI appreciate any and all help that is offered. Please let me know if anything I stated is vague, or if I can offer any more details on what I have tried. Thank you very much in advance. "}

Are there any good reasons training with L-BFGS is much less popular (or at least talked about) than SGD and variants? For the deep learning practitioners, have you ever tried using L-BFGS or other quasi-Newton or conjugate gradient methods?\n\nIn a similar vein, has anyone experimented with doing a line search for optimal step size during each gradient descent step? A little searching found nothing more recent than earlier 1990's.\n\nedit: Thanks for all the responses. Sounds like high memory usage from L-BFGS + adequate performance from with SGD with tricks is the reason that L-BFGS isn't typically used.

Never used more than 10 gradient memory vectors, had mixed results with performance similar to Adam when using ReLU and superior when using tanh.\n* http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.7020 - impressive convergence speed and nice framework, but only applied algorithm to convex problems\n","from":null,"locked":false,"media_embed":{},"created_utc":1458945893,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"ups":46,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","author_flair_text":null,"title":"L-BFGS and neural nets","archived":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/4bys6n/lbfgs_and_neural_nets/","from_id":null,"link_flair_text":null,"score":46,"author":"lightcatcher","subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","edited":1458976180,"quarantine":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"retrieved_on":1463497325,"secure_media_embed":{},"downs":0}

It is just a simple one hidden layer feedforward neural network. I find an example in Internet showing that it can be trained using two output nodes, one for probability of 0 and the other for that of 1. But I think it is kind of cheating as it assumes the output of the function is either 0 or 1. Any pointer is appreciated, thanks!  \n\n**EDIT**  \nIt is an embarrassing bug that the trained example is wrong, thanks for pointing out.\nOne more follow-up question, I found that sigmoid must be used in the output layer. I guess it is because sigmoid scale the output in range [-1, 1], which again is kind of cheating? My question is do we need to scale the output to a limited range using a proper function in output layer? Why NN can't tune the weight to learn the range instead?\n","from":null,"locked":false,"media_embed":{},"gilded":0,"created_utc":1458952824,"distinguished":null,"ups":0,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","author_flair_text":null,"title":"neural network using tensorflow fail to learn xor function","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/4bz7bg/neural_network_using_tensorflow_fail_to_learn_xor/","archived":false,"from_id":null,"link_flair_text":null,"score":0,"author":"ming0308","subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","edited":1458982840,"quarantine":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"retrieved_on":1463497521,"downs":0}

It's not by any means an example of qualitative implementation or important research.\n\nSo, I took inspiration from the famous DeepMind paper that showed how they made a machine learn how to play Atari Games by only using screenshots of the game as an input. Instead of those games, I chose a 3D game: Doom (the original, 1993 game), running in an DOS emulator.\n\nFor now, my machine is limited to trying to learn how to move in the 3D environment and to learn how the map is structured. So far, it can learn how to go from point A to point B with an accuracy of about 60%, but a lot (and I mean a lot) of improvements can be made. \n\nThe main idea is as follows: the machine learns a model represented by an infinite state machine that has been reduced to a finite state machine, where each state is essentialy a frame from the game and where multiple, similar frames are grouped together (state set reduction policy). For this, I use similarity detection techniques such as simple euclidean distance, histogram comparison and perceptual hash (image fingerprinting) comparison. After a while, the machine will have learnt the game map and will know which actions will produce which result given the state it is currently in. This framework would suit a future implementation of Q-Learning (and its deep counterpart) to actually make the machine learn how to play and not just how to move.\n\nIf you're interested, here are some links!\n\nLink of code on GitHub: https://github.com/banex19/DeepDoom\n\nLink of PDF report with description of the algorithm/idea behind it: https://goo.gl/4yR9N9","name":"t3_4c0s6d","id":"4c0s6d","num_comments":20,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/4c0s6d/hey_reddit_i_tried_to_make_a_machine_learn_how_to/","stickied":false,"secure_media":null,"hide_score":false,"preview":{"images":[{"id":"2MjvaDkUy8IL5WYKXH5fb0Tt9rZyLemD8oAwAVmHU6o","variants":{},"resolutions":[{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/AL_0GQwgcX8JikDzF4z8nnWwxQ2JuzRy9c2w3BJoMhw.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=41d983f52f81442a6d7131c35a1cc3bb","height":108,"width":108},{"height":216,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/AL_0GQwgcX8JikDzF4z8nnWwxQ2JuzRy9c2w3BJoMhw.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=98b760b5822479c1e9e96f369b5d3ca5","width":216},{"height":320,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/AL_0GQwgcX8JikDzF4z8nnWwxQ2JuzRy9c2w3BJoMhw.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=a895562f83df0141cb7369d980f25891","width":320}],"source":{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/AL_0GQwgcX8JikDzF4z8nnWwxQ2JuzRy9c2w3BJoMhw.jpg?s=1c5585f95f8e6c4b182e6c11d7df9584","height":420,"width":420}}]},"from_kind":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"over_18":false,"media":null,"saved":false,"thumbnail":"self","is_self":true,"subreddit":"MachineLearning"}

One day, Joe posts on /r/cars on Tuesday at noon. The system notices this and says \"Hey Joe, are you sure you should be posting on /r/cars?

Using the [pattern database](https://heuristicswiki.wikispaces.com/pattern+database) approach I've already made a solver that works by utilizing the two Fringe and Corner patterns (500MB respectively) in addition to the two smaller patterns for the space not covered by them (5MB respectively.) The max of those four patterns for a given position plus the number of moves taken is my cost function for this problem.\n\nMy goal for this project is to not only to memorize those four patterns, but to [build on that work](https://github.com/mrakgr/N-Puzzle-Experiments/tree/master/N%20Puzzle) and hopefully solve the 4x4 completely using neural nets. Currently, the [Fringe Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fringe_search) solver can solve problems up to 50 under a second, but it chokes on problems that need -78 a -80 moves. Those problems would come within reach if I could improve the value function and machine learning is really the only way forward at this point as patterns larger than Fringe and Corner would be too big for my machine.\n\nWith that reasoning, I've started by trying to compress one of the smaller 5Mb patterns, but the results have been discouraging as I cannot get the accuracy on even a single minibatch of 2560 to go over 50% using a simple feedforward net.\n\nHere is what has worked the best for me so far:\none hot encoding for the inputs, one hot encoding for the outputs (255 outputs on for each possible byte value), feedforward 112-3072-255 net with cross entropy cost.\n\nI've tried scalar inputs and outputs, binary encoded inputs and outputs, and the one hot encoding works best. \n\nVarying the size of the single hidden layer does not make a difference on the minibatch, it always converges to around 50% accuracy. What troubles me about this is that adding layers makes it work significantly worse. Even a single layer makes the training much longer and harder and in the end it does not exceed the performance of a single layer.\n\nI've expected that I would get difficulties training as I add layers and increase size, but not this soon and not on a single 2560 minibatch. That reminds me that the N puzzle is a genuine NP Hard problem.\n\nWhat I could do from here is add convolutional nets and pretraining to make training easier, but I want to ask here first if I am missing something?\n\nThanks.","name":"t3_4ceovd","id":"4ceovd","num_comments":1,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/4ceovd/how_to_compress_the_value_function_for_the_n/","stickied":false}

The data set I'm working with to train the classifier is unbalanced. I have various songs from all kinds of genre categories, but some categories have more sample data in them than others. For instance, \"rock\", \"jazz\", and \"raphiphop\" have hundreds of training samples, but another category called \"funksoulrnb\" only has a couple of dozen.\n\nI didn't think this would be a massive problem but I found that my classifier tends to classify songs as \"rock\", \"jazz\", or \"raphiphop\" more often than as other categories. It has a pretty stellar accuracy rate on those categories, but it doesn't perform as well on categories with less samples. In fact, from the confusion matrices I'm generating ([here](http://puu.sh/nU5XC.png)'s one), it seems as though the less training samples a particular genre category has, the worse the classifier performs on it.\n\nI have tried [bagging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_aggregating), whereby I train multiple classifiers using a uniform random sampling of each category and then take the majority vote of each predicted category during testing. This unfortunately doesn't seem to improve anything.\n\nIs there anything I can do to circumvent this problem, or are unbalanced datasets just awkward to work with either way?\n\nThanks!","num_comments":11,"id":"4cfv11","stickied":false,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/4cfv11/working_with_unbalanced_data_sets/","distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"created_utc":1459264501,"from":null,"media_embed":{},"locked":false}

Its focus was initially on hidden Markov models (which are very fully featured and based off a sparse implementation), but grew into a host of probabilistic models. I've just released 0.4.0 which contains a host of new updates/bug fixes, some nice speed increases, new models, a more unified sklearn api, and an out of core API for training all models with data that can't fit in memory. Our fancy new website has a host of documentation and an API reference for all models: http://pomegranate.readthedocs.org/en/latest/\n\npomegranate currently supports the following models:\n\n* a wide range of probability distributions\n* general mixture models (of any distributions)\n* hidden markov models\n* naive bayes (of any distributions/models)\n* markov chains\n* discrete bayesian networks\n* factor graphs\n* finite state machines\n\nTutorials on how to use these models are here: https://github.com/jmschrei/pomegranate/tree/master/tutorials\n\nMore examples on using these models are here:\nhttps://github.com/jmschrei/pomegranate/tree/master/examples\n\npomegranate's cython implementation is extremely fast. It does extremely well when [comparing hidden Markov models](https://github.com/jmschrei/pomegranate/blob/master/benchmarks/pomegranate_vs_hmmlearn.ipynb) to [hmmlearn](https://github.com/hmmlearn/hmmlearn),  when [comparing General Mixture models](https://github.com/jmschrei/pomegranate/blob/master/benchmarks/pomegranate_vs_sklearn_gmm.ipynb) to [sklearn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn), and when [comparing Naive Bayes](https://github.com/jmschrei/pomegranate/blob/master/benchmarks/pomegranate_vs_sklearn_naive_bayes.ipynb) to sklearn. In most cases it is several times faster than the other implementations as well as more memory efficient.\n\nCurrently multithreaded training is supported for hidden Markov models, and I plan on implementing multithreading for all fitting and prediction methods in the next release. \n\nI'd love to get your feedback on the project. Installation is as easy as `pip install pomegranate` on any operating system. If you find any bugs or have any suggestions please open an issue on the [github repo](https://github.com/jmschrei/pomegranate).","media_embed":{},"locked":false,"from":null,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0,"created_utc":1459357082,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","author_flair_text":null,"ups":29,"from_id":null,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/4clnrg/pomegranate_v040_fast_and_flexible_probabilistic/","title":"pomegranate v0.4.0: fast and flexible probabilistic modelling for python","archived":false,"score":29,"link_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","author":"ants_rock","quarantine":false,"retrieved_on":1463508149,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_css_class":null,"downs":0}

I'm nearing my undergrad final year in Computer Science and time has come to choose a subject for my final project. Let me start by saying I don't have much practical experience with machine learning - my background is mainly software development. I did just finish a stats course though and I intend to learn Tensorflow and deep learning from Coursera/Udacity for the purpose of completing this project.\n\nI'll cut to the chase. Turns out my mentor specializes in audio signal processing. I was always interested in computer-generated sounds, so my first thought was to make some sort of a VST plugin synthesizer / weird instrument.\n\nHowever, recently I found myself thinking more and more about doing something involving deep learning, especially after seeing [projects like this](https://imgur.com/6mDCmRq) and wondering if the same technique could be applied to audio. That is, combining two sounds to generate something else. I'd like to ask you if you think accomplishing this is viable and where to start.\n\nAnother possible (although I admit, less exciting) project would involve music classification (i.e by genre or release decade) as described in [this great post](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3s4vkn/google_brains_deep_learning_library_tensorflow_is/cwulcew) by /u/gindc. \n\nI'd love to hear your ideas for an interesting project involving deep learning and sound. Also, advice and any links relevant to the subject are greatly appreciated.

My company, eContext, has curated a universal taxonomy over the past nine years that encompasses everything commercially and socially relevant on the web. It is made up of 650M real user search queries bucketed into 25 vertical categories (Auto, Health, Finance, etc.) containing roughly 450K sub-categories. It's a rule-based system, and we use NLP and nGram chunking to parse long and short form text and map search queries, social posts, web content, blogs, forums, reviews, etc. to the category hierarchy providing structured, topical intelligence to data streams at scale. It is extremely accurate because we've built 55M controlled vocabularies (Ex. rules determine the difference between bowtie pasta &amp; bowtie gift wrapping).\n\nI understand that supervised training models require a corpus of text from which a model can determine entities, ontological connections, and apply statistical models to understand what people, places, things, concepts are and how they may be connected, but we've already built out the taxonomy to understand connections between things, and can provide greater context to \"what\" something truly is. For example, you have a corpus of text containing different types of vehicles - Pick up truck, Ford F150, Toyota Camry, Jetski, bicycle, helicopter, accord, etc. eContext would map each of those to a category resulting in a list of concepts, but further, provide the context automatically by recognizing that all of these things fall into the \"Vehicles\" category. Accord, Toyota Camry, Ford F150, and pick up truck all fall under the Vehicles::Automotive Vehicles branch (implies the connection there), and further Accord and Toyota Camry both fall into a child of Automotive, that being \"sedans\" - Vehicles::Automotive Vehicles::Sedans\n\nwe\u2019re looking to develop and test a hypothesis around the automatic, hierarchal category annotation and enrichment of unstructured text data to improve the efficiency and efficacy of supervised machine learning processes. In your experience, would being able to provide structure and meaning that can be used instead of using existing unstructured text in unsupervised models have benefit? Would this be more useful with a corpus of text from various channels sources that isn\u2019t uniform, but represents consumer behavior \u2013 search keywords, click stream/URL data, social posts?\n\nAny help anyone could provide would be greatly appreciated, and if you're interested in helping us develop and test a hypothesis, please send me a message.

I built a q-learning agent for Othello.  It is table-based, so it obviously doesn't work well because the state-space of Othello is just too big for a table.\n\nSo for the past week I've been investigating neural networks as q-learning approximators.  I even put one together using Keras/Theanos, and something's going right because it wins 90% of games against an opponent that plays purely randomly (but gets crushed against monte-carlo, another agent I wrote, even if the simulation time for MC is very very short).\n\nMy biggest point of confusion is the design of this neural network.\n\nObviously I have 64 input nodes, one per board position.  There's one hidden layer of somewhere between 42 and 256 nodes (I'm always changing that to see if I can find a number that performs better).\n\nThe real challenge is the output layer.\n\nThe most common network model I've seen for TD learning is to just have one output node which gives the evaluation approximation of the board that was passed in.\n\nBut Q learning doesn't work that way.  Q learning requires a state,action pair as input.  Anything else and you're not doing Q learning (though you might be doing value iteration instead).  State,action pair goes in, reward comes out.  I guess if I were to interpret that as literally as possible, I'd have 65 inputs: the 64 for all board positions, and 1 for the action I take, and then one output node: the value of that state/action pair that was passed in.\n\nHowever, that seems \"inorganic\" for a neural network, to me.  I'm not convinced a network will converge well using that scheme.  What I've done instead is have 64 outputs: one for each spot on the board.  I pass in the board state, and then each of the 64 outputs is the value of the action of me playing at that state (of course I have a list of legal positions and just find the legal move with the best value).\n\nThis seems more suited to a neural network than the scheme of \"64 for board state + 1 for move goes in, value comes out\".  However, I'm now worried that having 64 output nodes will be too many for an accurate network.  I don't know if it's feasible for the network to converge well when it has to evaluate 64 different moves for all inputs (even if in the end I only care about something like 3-10).\n\nAnyone have advice here?  I'm very new to neural nets, so this is a brand new world to me and my intuition isn't guiding me very well.

A technical paper describing the optimization is available at http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.07749.  It is available as free and open source software. This release is just the first step toward providing a suite of algorithms that will assist biomedical researchers in analyzing their data to obtain causal insights.\n\u00a0\u00a0\nUsing simulated data, FGS was able to learn a causal network on data containing 50,000 variables and 1,000 samples in about 15 minutes on a laptop computer. While FGS does not model hidden variables that cause two or more measured variables, an upcoming release of another algorithm will do so.\n\nFGS is available as a command line implementation (Causal-cmd) that calls a local Java library or as a Java web application (Causal-web) that runs the analysis at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center; the API\u2019s can also be run through R (R-causal) or Python (Py-causal). Additional details and instructions for downloading both these versions of the software are available at \nhttp://www.ccd.pitt.edu/wiki/index.php?title=Tools_and_Software.\n\nOur goal is to help the biomedical community use causal modeling to gain novel insights and drive innovative research, so we hope to make these tools as usable and useful as possible.  We welcome any and all feedback that you might have, which will help us improve this and future releases.

I switched to Linux because a lot of different sources indicate that a installation on windows/osx is even harder. First I tried to install Caffe. But after a while I had to give up. The Cuda dependencies and Cmake overpowered my abilities. After that I convinced myself that I could live without c++ and tried a python environment. I tried to install Theano. I had the naive  presumption that installing a python library would be painless.. Oh dear was I wrong. So now to my actual question, because I accepted for myself that I am not worthy of my own running deep learning library. Why is it such a pain in the arse to install to install those libraries? I mean I understand that it is difficult to use a gpu instead off a cpu. And I understand the necessity for the code to be written in c. And of course I know how hard it is to maintain such big and complex projects. But for ducks sake. If you look at scikit-learn for comparison. It simply works out of the box, is fast and well structured. Deep learning libraries on the other hand are driving me nuts with their dependency trees. I simply can't install the packages. I mean... NN's have such a big medial impact in the last few years. I can't be the only one who has had the idea of setting up his own net. And I refuse to believe that I am the only one who had such problems. Is it purpose that this technology is not available to the public? Do they fear that this technology contains to much power for the simple minded? Is the government behind all of this? :D\nI could write here for ours and it would even be a fraction of the time I invested in this. Maybe I should try and write my own NN package.. Ahh...

But I'd like to try more approaches.\n\nAt what (family of) algorithm(s) should I be looking at?
