Currently I'm enrolled in the ML course @coursera, taught by Andrew Ng, to get a first impression about Machine Learning. I'm completely new to this topic, but since I have a linear algebra and calculus background from my physics studies and also programming experience in C, python, matlab and other languages, the course (content and speed) feels too easy for me. I know that there are older lecture videos on youtube from Ng where he taught Machine Learning before (not @coursera) and I was wondering if somebody knows these lecture videos and could tell me if they maybe are more appropriate for me?\n\n\nMy next question is: Can you recommend a book for ME? I know, everyone asks this questions and there already are a lot of lists. The book I'm looking for should contain at least the basics of different branches, so besides learning the application of ML, I also want to get an overview of everything. Furthermore, I don't mind if it contains more math than other books, proofs are okay too.

So far, I like the book, but I'm a little overwhelmed of the material, especially by the bayesian theory and the different approaches to solve a problem (I just finished Chapter 1 about Probability Theory and Decision Theory). I would really like to see the application of these ideas (implemented algorithms in matlab or python) to \"play\" with the algorithm and then write my own stuff. Sadly, there are no software examples in this book. Can you recommend any other resources (websites, books) for this?","secure_media_embed":{},"secure_media":null,"banned_by":null,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false}
