But this subreddit has grown since then, and I'd like the see if there is any sort of consensus.\n\nContext: I'm a 2nd year PhD student in ML. In my first year, I decided that academia isn't for me, and that I'd like to go into industry after my PhD. Recently, I've seen that if one's intentions are to go into industry, then the MS is the superior degree. But I have also seen that a lot of machine learning jobs require PhDs.\n\nTo be honest, I'm leaning towards bailing with a masters, because I can always come back for the PhD if I dislike my options in industry. Before I bring this up with my advisor, though, I'd like to know what sort of jobs I can expect to get. If it changes anything, I have two bachelors degrees (applied math and physics) that aren't in CS. \n\nSo, if I don't much care about doing fundamental research in ML, is stopping at a masters degree going to close a lot of doors?
