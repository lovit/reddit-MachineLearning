I'm interested in learning about artificial intelligence and machine learning, particularly optical character recognition. Are there any good books or resources that you'd recommend?\n\nMy maths background needs a lot of dusting up on, so i'd appreciate anything that teaches the maths as well (if / where its needed).\n\nThanks.","is_self":true,"media":null,"link_flair_css_class":null,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"banned_by":null,"secure_media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","title":"Book / resource recommendations for machine learning / artificial intelligence?","author":"[deleted]","url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1qk1hn/book_resource_recommendations_for_machine/","subreddit":"MachineLearning","stickied":false}

E.g, having a dataset, like the size of houses and their prices, and then predicting the price of a house based on its size. I thought of lots of cool ways that a program could be written to predict this. For example, loop over the dataset, get the 'gap' between the prices (e.g if a 1 square meter house sells for 100k, and a 2 sq meter house sells for 120k, then the gap is 20k), and then get the average gap in price per square meter. And use that to calculate / predict the price of any given house, based on the house sizes closest to it. (E.g if on average the price increases by 10k per sq meter, and the price of a 10 sq meter house is 100k, and you're asked to predict an 11 sq meter house's price, you would say 100k+10 = 110k).\n\nBut instead, the solution given for solving this problem in the ML course I'm taking, just seems to involve memorizing a formula, punching that formula into octave, and letting it figure out the result. I'm seeing very little actual programming being done.\n\nIs that all machine learning is? Just memorizing formulas and applying them to different datasets / attributes? Or is there any of the problem solving involved which makes regular programming fun?\n\nThanks.","created_utc":1384391864,"is_self":true,"media":null,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"ups":0,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a software developer, and I&amp;#39;m looking into machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I first looked into it, it seemed very interesting and fun. E.g, having a dataset, like the size of houses and their prices, and then predicting the price of a house based on its size. I thought of lots of cool ways that a program could be written to predict this. For example, loop over the dataset, get the &amp;#39;gap&amp;#39; between the prices (e.g if a 1 square meter house sells for 100k, and a 2 sq meter house sells for 120k, then the gap is 20k), and then get the average gap in price per square meter.
