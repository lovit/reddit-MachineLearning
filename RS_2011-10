My group has decided that for our first attempt (just to get us off the ground, before we delve into using WordNet and other resources), we are going to use simple search results numbers. In our testing, it&amp;#39;s worked pretty well so far.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The question I have is, does anyone here know of any search engine that:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A) Allows scraping like this (not of actual results, just the number of results)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;B) Allows scraping at all (apparently Bing is fine with it so long as the query is sent by a human, which could be implemented...kind of)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, any tips would be greatly appreciated. I&amp;#39;ve been cooking up some ideas for identifying the &amp;#39;direction&amp;#39; of the main action verb (generally these sentences are &amp;#39;A acts on B and (he/she/it) acts&amp;#39;, in which the secondary action makes the determination as to whom the antecedent of (he/she/it, the anaphora) refers) along with any positive/negative aspects of that verb and the &amp;#39;direction&amp;#39; of the secondary action along with any positive/negative aspects of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An example would be:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Charles hit Sam and he didn&amp;#39;t like it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This can be broken down into Charles acts negatively on Sam. The anaphor responds negatively, so the anaphor is most likely being acted negatively upon, which in this case is Sam.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know how viable this method would be, but I&amp;#39;m interested in trying it out. The best part (in my mind) about this method is that is uses genuine learning instead of just rules for resolution.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any assistance in this would be greatly appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","created":1318439917,"hidden":false,"over_18":false}
