One thing that the panelist asked me to think of is if I were to start, what would I work on.\n\nNow the thing is so far with my PhD someone has always given me a problem and I went away and worked out the maths behind it. \n\nSo my question is what are the upcoming areas in theoretical BAYESIAN machine learning. My speciality I would say is in Variational Bayes. I like this area because 1. Fast compared to sampling 2. There is quite a bit of maths involved.\n\nNew areas that I want to get into is stochastic Variational Bayes. This is a technique that helps deal with big data. This answer in itself didn't seem satisfactory. So I'm putting it out there to see what would be a good area/ project to work on. Something theoretical but might have a real world application. I'm happy to consider things like Deep Learning as long as there are mathematical problems involved.\n\np.s. yes I realise this might be quite open ended","media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/3bpa1y/upcoming_areas_in_theoretical_machine_learning/","title":"Upcoming areas in theoretical Machine Learning","secure_media_embed":{},"downs":0,"thumbnail":"default","distinguished":null,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","hide_score":false,"created_utc":"1435714647","author_flair_text":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"MachineLearning"}

It's just that I have an image in my head that I'd really like to make a reality, but I utterly suck at AI-programming.\n\nThe thing I have in mind is this:\n\nA white background filled with colored dots. Every colored dot is like a living being, meaning it can take a few actions, it has a few needs and it has a few feelings. The actions it can take are: changing its color and moving around. The needs it has are:\n\n* Being around other dots X percent of the time\n* Being alone (100 - X) percent of the time\n* Being (around) cold colors Y percent of the time\n* Being (around) warm colors (100 - Y) percent of the time\n* Dancing and moving Z percent of the time\n* Staying calm and still (100 - Z) percent of the time.\n\nX, Y and Z differ per dot and that's what makes every dot a unique living being. And finally it feels pleasant feelings when it just fulfilled one of its needs and it feels unpleasant feelings when one of its needs have not been fulfilled recently.\n\nA dot is not aware of its needs, its only aware of its feelings and tries to take actions that lead to pleasant feelings.\n\nI imagine that this app would create a beautiful \"dance of life\" to look at. All the dots will just try stuff out to find out what's the nicest way to live. And what I most like about this app is the very clear absence of right and wrong / normal and abnormal.

Something similar as what is done [here](http://voidpatterns.org/2015/03/conspiracy-theories-topic-modeling-keyword-extraction/). Going by the blog post it seems that the beta parameter is what gives us the relative weight of each term in the topic. When I examine my betas I get values ranging from approximately  -6 to -12. The negative values suggest that maybe this is a log likelihood measure? I don't really have the stats background to confidently say how to best map the betas to a metric that could play nice with word clouds frequency.  parameter. Any advice is much appreciated.\n\nI am not sure if this is a subreddit that is okay with people asking for help, but everything else on this topic is pretty dead. Happy to re-post in a more appropriate place if needed. Also, it doesn't really matter in this case but I am implementing this in R. \n\nThanks. \n\nedit: 24 hours and 2 downvotes, and zero upvotes.

How many nodes per layer? Should each layer have less or more than the previous or should they be random? Should I train one layer at a time?

The better parameters I could find just barely outperform (F1 &amp; ROC_AUC metrics) a bog standard logistic regression with a tuned C, implemented in scikit-learn - and an SVM with an RBF kernel strongly outperforms the LogReg itself. Being outperformed by a different model (e.g. Decision trees) would make plenty of sense, but a Neural Net should be able to do anything a LogReg can. The code/nets are all implemented in Keras and/or Lasagne (I'm experimenting with both). \n\n#Data Details: \nTraining+ Evaluation set hold ~2,491 samples (~800 positive class) - Binary classification. Metric of choice is the F1 score. \n Features: ~1,200 \"raw\". Filtering the set to remove zero variance features, along with a FDR (ANOVA) test (alpha = 0.01) drops that down to 500 features. (An FDR with an alpha of 0.7 drops it down to about ~900 features. Many features are co-linear; Applying a PCA on the data dropped performance notably, and reduced the NNet performance more than the LogRegs ). \nFeatures are sequence properties for a protein, manually extracted, and not necessarily sharing any form of spatial order (e.g. one feature is the count of each letter in a sequence). There are DEFINITELY higher order interactions between features. \nFeatures are a mix of variables (e.g. \"propensity for X= -0.21\") and counts (e.g. \"AA@position 7 = R\" (1 hot encoded)). Data is normalized (using sklearn). \n\n*So, Any tips on architectures or functions to use?*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&gt; Sample architectures:\nNoted performance is on the validation set each time. Networks are trained, with the held-out validation set's performance use as the \"stopping\" criteria.

The host creates a matrix of a given size, distributes neurons into 3 layers (1 input [layer 1], 1 output [layer 3] and the rest on a middle hidden layer [layer 2]). It gives each neuron as many random weights than there are neurons, a value between 0 and 4. I then input a number which is given to the input neuron's value, and it runs Network.\n\nNetwork will take each neuron in order, check if his layer is not input, then for each neuron whose layer is right before him (so layer-1) it will multiply its value by the given weight for that neuron and add it to its own value. It goes on like this and then displays the output neuron's value. Back to the Host.\n\nHost will divide the obtained number by the wanted number (input*2) and will see how much correction is needed. It will then apply the correction to each and every weight on the grid. So if the output was 2x the wanted value, it will divide each weight by 2.\n\nBottom line is that it works, but I'm really unsure whether it qualifies as a neural network as it's easy and fast and the correction part seems like cheating. Also, the less neurons I have the faster it reaches optimal values (around the goal) and I doubt that's how it's supposed to be.\n\nAnyone care to explain if anything was done wrong and what it is?

In computer vision, SIFT and SURF features were patented. This caused major annoyances for open-source software libraries like OpenCV. The Debian repos did not contain the \"nonfree\" module, so users had to build from source, which was a major hassle. The same thing may happen in future open-source machine learning libraries.\n2. These new patents cast doubt on any new company based on machine learning and make it harder to attract investments -- now there is the looming threat that Google has rights to their IP and can sue or at least use the patents as a bargaining chip in case of a legal dispute.\n\n\nEDIT: two more additions to the first list: 5.

There are a total of 15 possible tags. The input neurons take 3 words, so, I have 45 input neurons, 15 for each word. Each word is looked up in a probability dictionary of that word being which part-of-speech. Most words only have 2-3 normal POS tags, so, a word often goes into the network as thirteen 0s and a .2 and .8 (in their designated tag locations).\n\nHowever, I've heard that this isn't a great way to represent the words to be tagged? I've heard that it might be better to give each word an embedded word representation. Or to use [GloVe](http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)? I'm not exactly sure how this would work... I understand that words can be represented in vectors with numbers, and many words have similarities to each other, such as Mother and Father, or Red and Blue, or Tennis and racket. However, I'm not sure how this would be implemented into a parts of speech tagging. I can see how more information like this could obviously be helpful, but I'm not sure how to actually implement it into a Neural Network.

Unless you have the intention of watching every video in its entirety, it is very hard to find the parts that matter most to you. This problem only gets worse for longer videos, where most people either drop off at the beginning, or use the video player scrubber to randomly scan the video in the hopes of finding something interesting. With ClipMine, we are reimagining online video by making video players more aware of the content being played. We use both *crowd-sourcing* and *machine intelligence* to tag interesting points inside online videos. Then, using our Content-Aware Video Player, anyone can share or embed their tagged videos with their audience to help them discover and view the content that matters most to them.\n**Note**:  We are featured on [producthunt](http://www.producthunt.com/tech/clipmine) today","id":"3cgb1b","archived":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"name":"t3_3cgb1b","saved":false,"over_18":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":4,"is_self":true,"author":"ojaved","from":null,"stickied":false,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/3cgb1b/a_collection_of_fully_tagged_machine_learning/","secure_media":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","from_kind":null,"created":1436296130,"from_id":null,"quarantine":false,"score":6,"edited":false}

I have a decent background in software engineering and math. I have passed several courses on machine learning, and comfortable with reading research papers. I did several internships during my undergrad study: one was a SWE-internship in Silicon Valley, another was a recommender systems research at a local company.\n\nThe job of my dream would be that at DeepMind (well, who wouldn't say that?), but I do realize that I have no research experience (i.e. published papers), so I aim a bit lower.\nAnother thing to note: I don't feel like these Data Science roles are right for me. I see them mostly as stats guys doing stuff in their excel / r / matlab with the outcome of better understanding your processes / audience, whereas SW guys deliver new features.\nAnd the final note is that I plan to do a lot of research during my MSc so in 2 years I can get into a decent PhD programme. Thus, good recommendation letters are a plus.\n\nSorry for the lengthy introduction. So my questions are:\n\n * What are my chances to get this kind of internship being a Master's student? Haven't they all been taken by hungry Phds? :-)\n * What can I do to improve these chances? I have something like 3-4 months before the applications start.\n * How should I position myself (both in CV and during interviews): should I emphasis my software engineering experience, my research attitude (mostly lots of ML-related courses), or something else.\n * How does an interview for such positions look like? Is it usual SW-interview (algorithms, programming techniques, etc) without any emphasis on ML part, or quite the reverse?\n\nTL;DR math-and-software-engineering heavy internship without business-shit is wanted. Preferably at a top company. And then there're 4 silly questions I want wisdom of reddit to answer.","retrieved_on":1440624520,"ups":0}

{"selftext":"In conferences such as CVPR / ICCV / NIPS, and in particular CV tracks, it seems impossible to publish a paper which either doesn't have some incredible mathematical background or involve some deep learning techniques. I have been submitting an article repeatedly to CVPR/ICCV/ECCV since 2013 that is a reasonably simple method, is well-formulated showing promising results on benchmark datasets. While all the reviewers in all my submissions seem to agree that my proposal is novel and that it is indeed superior to many SOTA and often times I get even more positive reviews, I get rejected on the notion that my method is \"simple\". I write rebuttals arguing the elegance and the superiority of my methods and while everyone agrees with everything I say, there is always still one reviewer who gives a borderline or a weak reject based on the fact that its not \"complicated enough\". Now I am also being forced to switch topics ( I am entering my fourth year of PhD) because of this reason.\n\nHere is my question: Many I have talked to seem to think that conferences like CVPR now focus more on engineering and on results rather than on novelty. Is this true ? If this is indeed true what are my alternatives to get my paper published. It is indeed a good method and shows good results and IMO fills a void in the literature, which quite frankly should have been filled ages ago. I really think that my paper should have been written in early part of last decade. Secondly, is it acceptable to switch topics so late in my PhD. I am thinking of getting into deep learning. Will I be perceived differently post-graduation, if at all I get to graduate in time, about my late change of topics ? \n\n[Update]: Thanks for all the suggestions. I am going to wait till ICCV 2015 rebuttal results come out (I am working on a good rebuttal and hopefully I can convert the last reviewer and convince the AC), but after that I will resubmit the same to either WACV or similar second-tier but I will also upload to arXiv, anonymously if I can make it.

{"ups":0,"retrieved_on":1440622104,"selftext":"Ok, so I was just here a few days ago with [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/3cdxf3/beginner_help_implementing_qlambda_learning_in/) post, and I think I figured out what the issue is, but I'm not sure how to solve it. \n\nIt seems like the problem is that, when it stops exploring, it just keeps increasing the Q-values of states that it's already deemed the best in the past. So for example, it visits the price 5 at a certain state and time and gets a reward. Then, in the next several episodes, it continues to visit 5, and continues getting a reward, adding that reward to the Q-value until it's pretty high. At that point, even if it were to explore at the same state and time, the reward it gets isn't enough to overcome the inflated Q-value, so it just goes right back to 5 in the next episode. There must be something wrong with my interpretation of how this is supposed to work, but I can't for the life of me figure it out.

These pressures for images to look like normal images are called \u201cnatural image priors\u201d or \u201cregularization.\u201d\" \n\nLets say, we got a synthetic image, produced with a BAD \"natural image prior\".\nQuestions:\n(1) This image activates a neuron maximally, but does not look like a natural image at all. Correct?\n(2) This image fools the DNN, as it is very confidently classified wrong and corresponds to an \"adversarial image\" (Goodfellow et al.). Correct?\n(3) Overall, on a higher level, does that mean that we - as humans - are trying to provide the DNN with our prior knowledge of the world?

Essentially I need to run an algorithm at a coarse resolution to generate possible detections/boxes.  Each box will be followed up by a multi-class convnet that examines the area at a high resolution.  I currently have the multi-class convnet working, and it works very well!, but a sliding window approach is just too slow.  The events at the coarse\nresolution are relatively sparse, so it would be nice to use a smaller convnet or other learning algorithm to search for areas of interest that could be classified with the multi-class convnet using the high resolution data.\n\n\nI am wondering if there is a good way to do:\n\nbinary image segmentation\n\nand/or\n\nbounding box detection / regression\n\n\nfor detection of rice kernels or mitosis cells in a grayscale image with varying backgrounds and interference.\n\n\nIt seems like there might be a way to perform the task with reinforcement learning or by using a method similar to \"Fully Convolutional Semantic Segmentation Models\".\n\nhttp://cs.berkeley.edu/~jonlong/long_shelhamer_fcn.pdf\n\n\nI have been using caffe for other multi-class convnet classification tasks and it has worked really well for me.

Despite Google Research has released the source code, it is quite challenging to make it run and it requires a lot of resources. For the ones of you who don't have too much experience with machine learning but still want to play with deep dreams, you can try the account [@DeepDreamThis](https://twitter.com/DeepDreamThis) on Twitter.

I'd like to get a few ngrams that were probably written by Jim (i.e., 90% +), but it's okay if I only get a few, and say \"uncertain\" for the rest.\n\nI'd like scores to be computed in isolation on each ngram.  I can't rely on the greater context.\n\nA very simple approach would be to have a list of many bigrams that Jim uses frequently and Bob uses infrequently in some training data.  If Jim used \"hello there\" 100 times in the training data, and Bob only 5 times, then in test data I could say with high confidence that \"hello there\" was said by Jim.\n\nI've read a bit about smoothing and interpolation, but my uneducated guess is that those are more aimed at scenarios where you need to provide an answer all the time.  Maybe that's not even a real distinction.\n\nBy short ngrams I mean 2-4.  I don't think single words are reliable enough\n\nAny tips?\n\nThanks.\n\nEDIT: My bad, this isn't really for classifying between two people, Jim and Bob.  I'm actually hoping to do this to get bits of main article content from a raw html page.  There's text that's noise, and then there's main-article text.  Again, I can't rely on anything like html path or density of certain ngrams.  It has to be done on an ngram in isolation.","media":null,"ups":1,"retrieved_on":1440615876}

Although I believe this game is actually solved, I think it would be a good learning exercise to write an ML program for this. Basically, liars dice is a turn based game where all players roll their dice while keeping them hidden (5 each at the start) and then go around making bets about the number of dice on the table (while only being able to see your own dice). Eg. \"three fours or four sixes\" Each player must either raise the bet or call the previous player a liar. When someone calls the previous player a liar, the hands are lifted and the player that was wrong (either the player who made the last bet or the player who called them a liar) must place one of their dice in the middle and out of play. The last player to still have some of their dice wins.\n\nI am very much a beginner in the machine learning field so I need some help coming up with a learning structure. My initial thought was to use genetic algorithms along with recurrent neural networks. Basically the RNN would be fed each previous bet, the values of the dice belonging to it and the total number of dice on the table and would output the bet it should make or some signal for calling the person a liar. Initially, a large population of RNNs would be randomly created (say 100) then a series of games would be started containing (2-5 randomly selected RNNs). The RNNs would be given points for adhering to the rules (making bets higher than the previous ones) and for winning games. Then the next population would be bred using tournament ranking where the top ranked RNNs would have a better chance of being picked to breed.\n\nI have a couple questions about this:\n\n* First of all, is it possible to feed an RNN different types of information at once (eg. a possibly infinite vector of previous bets along with a fixed vector of dice and a fixed number of total dice) and how would I go about doing this?\n* Secondly, would this method work in practice? I feel confident that this program could create RNNs that adhere to the rules of the game but I'm not sure how much strategy these RNNs can develop when they are not playing \"good\" competitors.","media":null,"ups":0,"retrieved_on":1440615696,"author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1436734538","subreddit":"MachineLearning","media_embed":{},"hide_score":false,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"distinguished":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"preview":{"images":[{"resolutions":[{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/KsbCQr4GNfn7DlpsaMAybKUXHZQfm5iAVYTj-tIArtU.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=e5cdd82b5b5d5e8fa33cb57078995e55","width":108,"height":71},{"width":216,"height":143,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/KsbCQr4GNfn7DlpsaMAybKUXHZQfm5iAVYTj-tIArtU.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=39b297ed6c485e9604a22088cf94a3c1"}],"source":{"height":146,"width":220,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/KsbCQr4GNfn7DlpsaMAybKUXHZQfm5iAVYTj-tIArtU.jpg?s=010b74512f423c2b45ee976406b438b6"},"variants":{},"id":"siSXMTGgDOXVr8Q4RSEcQ591EO9e0h7GFFuxr9NdCew"}]},"title":"Using RNNs to develop a program that can play liar's dice."}

The class also had a high focus on the theory behind these algorithms so i know a lot of the relates maths.\n\nBut all of our projects were based on simple numbers. What I mean by that is all of the projects had features which were simple numbers such as miles per gallon, year, horsepower, weight, frequency, etc.  We never made anything that could understand more abstract things like text, or color, etc. \n\nI recently stumbled upon [this article]( http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/scienceandtech/14276-Magic-The-Gathering-Cards-Made-by-Artificial-Intelligence) about a recurrent neural network that makes up its own Magic: The Gathering cards and my interest in ML was piqued again. I want to learn to implement something which can learn about things besides basic numbers, I want to make something that can learn to put sentences together like the one in this article. Hell it even makes up its own words (fuseback) that don't exist in Magic and added rules text to them (like for Tromple).\n\nWhat resources are there to learn how to make a system which can learn these more abstract ideas like words and colors?\n\nSecondly, I recently saw [this YouTube video]( https://youtu.be/u2t77mQmJiY) of someone implementing a genetic algorithm to watch two animated tanks learn to shoot each other.

For example, there are a lot of notions in physics like \"perpetual motion machines\" and \"free energy\" that are impossible, although there still are a lot of wackjobs trying to invent them. A better example would be the case of the compression scheme that can compress any data. This example is a little bit harder to debunk, it actually doesn't sound all that crazy. It is still impossible though, due to the pigeonhole principle (you can't fit N items in N-1 containers). \n\nAre there any areas in machine learning that one would better avoid, regarding my previous examples?

I had completed a course in Machine Learning in college as well as Andrew NG's course on coursera (albeit partially) in the second year. During this period, I completed two decently good projects:\n\n1) Active Learning based Sentence classifier of Scientific Papers\n    - Query by committee sampling method was used to train an active learning classifier. It was implemented by writing a decision tree classifier to annotate these papers.\n2) Time series based forecasting of product sales in a local super market.\n\t- The Naive bayes classification technique was used.\n\nDue to a few reasons, I lost touch with the field of ML and haven't been very active in reading up on new research nor completing projects in this field.\n\nI am finding it difficult to remember the logic I used while using these methodologies to complete my projects, hence I plan to do a quick overview of the relevant/most important ML algorithms and techniques. I have come up with this preliminary list of topics to cover in the next 14 days and I would appreciate it if anyone could direct me in the right direction. \n\nTechniques to read up on:\n\t\n        I) Supervised Learning:\n\t\ta) Classification:\n\t\t\t1) Logistic regression\n\t\t\t2) Linear SVM and kernel SVM\n\t\t\t3) Random Forests\n\t\t\t4) Neural Networks\n\t\t\t5) Ensemble Methods: Bagging\n\t\t\t6) Naive Bayes\n\t\tb) Regression:\n\t\t\t1) Least Square Method\n\n\tII) Unsupervised:\n\t\ta) k-means clustering\n\n\tIII) Reinforcement Learning\n\n\tIV) Dimensionality redution Techniques\n\nAny feedback regarding this above list would be appreciated.

I'm thinking about starting a for-fun project for my learning sake and hoping someone can tell me whether this would actually work.\n\nThis would be another image classifier. The use case is as follows:\n\n1. A user visits a web application I've built (which fronts the neural net)\n1. The user bulk uploads 1,000 or so photos (probably using FTP)\n1. After upload, the user is presented with a list of all their photos\n1. The user now can select 5 - 10 or so similar photos\n1. The selections are passed to the neural net, and the neural net finds all photos within (and only within) the user's 1,000 or photos\n1. The user now sees a filtered list of photos they uploaded based on the 5 - 10 similar photos they selected.\n\nSo let's say a user uploads 1,000 photos of car parts, and then they select 5 - 10 photos of just tires; their 1,000 photos would then be filtered to only show tires.\n\nOr let's say I have 1,000 photos of clothing, and I select 5 - 10 photos of shirts; I would only see shirts from my 1,000 photos.

{"ups":1,"retrieved_on":1440609588,"selftext":"Skip to the final two paragraphs to get to the real point of this post.\n\nI'm working for my university this summer attempting to analyze timbre of various instruments and play styles. The end goal is to find a way to *visually* separate a 'desirable' tone from a 'poor' tone using data from real time FFTs. We hope to be able to design an app for students that will allow a teacher to record sounds that are 'desirable', have them displayed as a region in some sort of 2 dimensional space, and then have the students attempt to match their tone to the teacher's by moving their own marker into that 'desirable' region by working on their technique. At the moment, we are trying to figure out which strategies we should be using in order to get the best spacial visualization for this purpose.\n\n**Warning**: Neither I nor my co-worker have taken a course in linear algebra, statistics, programming, or machine learning (why they hired us, I'm not sure). We've done our best to learn about each of these topics from Google (as well as some other resources), but we certainly haven't mastered any of it. It's very possible I'm going to sound like an idiot at multiple points.\n\nIf you have any suggestions for any part of our process below, please let me know! So far, our process goes a little something like this:\n\n**Record audio**: We asked our performers to play various scales in ways both 'good' and 'bad' in order to find patterns between 'good', 'pure', 'developed' tone and 'poor', 'elementary', 'muddled' tone. The best format we've found for doing so is in wav, 44.1khz, 16-bit, mono.\n\n**Standardize length of audio**: I wrote some code to chop up all of the audio files into pieces of 2205 samples each (50 milliseconds). It seemed like most audio analysis tools lean more towards 20 milliseconds, but we thought that the FFT appeared to be losing too much resolution at that point and took it a step longer.\n\n**Take FFTs**: We're using np.fft.rfft simply because it appeared to work best for our needs.\n\n**Find the fundamental**: We had the most luck using a piece of code found [here](https://gist.github.com/endolith/255291). The autocorrelation method was the only one that gave us consistently reasonable results, so we settled on that one by default. If anyone has better suggestions, I'd certainly be open to trying them.\n\n**Normalize the FFTs**: For each piece of audio, we divide the amplitudes by the max amplitude and the frequency data given by np.fft.rfftfreq by the fundamental in order to do away with differences in pitch and volume.\n\n**Interpolate and stack**: We use scipy.interpolate.griddata to take all of the frequency and amplitude data and line it up with each other. Right now, we're just arbitrarily choosing one of the normalized frequency arrays as the basis for the rest, but I'm guessing there's a more fool-proof way to do this. If you know of one, please let me know.\n\n**Interpret the data!**: At this point, we can visualize all of the FFTs directly by graphing them together (to see differences in harmonics between each instrument), or we can feed them into a PCA(principal component analysis) or LDA(linear discriminant analysis), both of which are taken from the scikit-learn library.\n\nThis last piece is where we need more help. Applying a PCA to the data reveals *some* differences between instruments, but timbre is a little too subtle to see any clear separation between our 'good' and 'bad' inputs. LDAs have been much more fruitful since we are able to specifically separate the data based on both instruments *and* type of timbre, but I'm getting worried that the separation is *too good* and may actually be misleading. When I input, for example, 'good' cello and 'bad' cello data, LDA returns only a single dimension with all of the 'good' on one side and all of the 'bad' on the other with next to zero mixing.

I have seen a number of papers that talk about accent classification.  What I want to do is along the same lines: given an audio clip is the speaker talking with accent A with greater than X% probability?\n\nMy approach thus far has been to break each of my labeled training clips into windows, construct a feature vector for each window, and train an SVM.  Then with another set of labeled training clips, I classify each window in each clip as being part of the accent or not, and then train for a threshold on the number of features in the clip labelled as being part of the accent.\n\nThe problem with this is rather obvious: given a window into a clip it is very likely that its classification is indeterminate (perhaps it's a pause, or a sound that doesn't leave much room for an accent to differentiate itself).  Also, an SVM doesn't really take into account what my goal is.  An SVM will do its best to differentiate between individual features in my two classes labeled \"yes\" or \"no\", but that isn't what I want--I want to be able to train a SVM that optimally differentiates between \"bags\" of features.  I have also read about using Gaussian Mixture Models for this sort of thing, but again, I am still worried that the large amount of common features will skew the model to be very sub-optimal.\n\nI remember back to my introductory class a problem where we used a \"bag of words\" representation of emails to classify them as spam.  In that case, it was easy to find the features that should be ignored since it is just a question of counting the occurrence of a given word in both classes.  Obviously in this case it isn't so simple because the features are very high-dimensional.  I can try clustering my features regardless of their labels and then mapping my audio clips into a \"bag of words\" linear classification model where the feature vector is the number of windows that map to a given cluster for a clip.  I could also try to do something to reduce the dimensionality of my features before the clustering.  However, in both cases, I still am afraid that the indeterminate features will dilute things by a lot.\n\nHas anyone ever faced a similar problems?  How did you approach it?  Any good papers to consult?  Thanks in advance!","retrieved_on":1440609167,"ups":1}

I followed the instructions in the thread and set up a nice Ubuntu VirtualBox VM running Torch7 and a LSTM RNN. However, it does it so damn slowly, due to being limited by my CPU through the VM and not being able to use my GPU. So my question is... how do I make it go faster?\n\n**The options that I'm aware of:**\n\n* Try to install Torch7 on Windows, to access CUDA with my gtx560 ti. Attempted this; it's heinously difficult and I've pretty much failed. One guy who's apparently done it responded to my email by saying, essentially, \"don't\". Failing that, install other software that can run on Windows and use CUDA, which can also do LSTM RNNs. Problem is, I don't know of any such software out there that fits those requirements.\n\n* Try to get PCI Passthrough working for Ubuntu in Virtualbox. This is tricky, but at least there's explicit instructions (unlike Torch for Windows, which involves arcane handwaving and guesswork). The one failure point is the requirement for the motherboard, cpu, the Ubuntu kernel, the BIOS, (the pet dog, my neighbour...) to all be IOMMU compatible, which for an Intel cpu translates as having VT-d. Now... my i7-2600k has VT-x. But, no VT-d. The i7-2600 (which I didn't buy, because hey, the K must be better IN ALL WAYS than the non-K, right?) has both VT-d and VT-x. Goddamnit, Intel. \nTherefore, the only way I can do PCI Passthrough (as far as I know) is to get a CPU with VT-x. Ok, but these days (if I want to maintain same number of cores, etc.) that means something like an i7-4790k. It's 400 CAD and won't fit into my Asus P8P67 motherboard, so add another 150 CAD for a new one. And after all that, PCI Passthrough might even not work that great. Yeesh. I don't know if there's other virtualization software out there that's free/low cost and lets a GPU run CUDA through it, but I find it unlikely (since I've searched and not found any).\n\n* Dual-boot Ubuntu. Probably the easiest option, but also the most annoying. I use Win7 as my daily OS, and there's plenty of stuff I can't do in Ubuntu that I can do in Win7. If I wanted to run training or sample a checkpoint file I'd have to be in Ubuntu, which is more annoying than being in Windows.\n\nSo ideally, I'd want to find a way of running Ubuntu through some sort of VM, on Win7 as the host, with it having access to my GPU for CUDA calculations.

We've been having a debate on what the best way would be to teach a machine to play poker (not solve GTO like the alberta project but teach it to be proficient at the game).\n\nI think the approach of having it play against itself and improving iteratively that way like the first checkers machine learning algorithm did is going to be far too inefficient with the complexity of no limit holdem. Another approach would be letting it learn from the hands that myself or my friend have played and draw conclusions from that, knowing that it will be drawing/learning from a base strategy of people who were winning players, so the assumption is that most of those plays are good plays.\n\nThat said, the issue we both have trouble with is how it would actually learn on it's own what is a good play or what is a bad play. There are many instances in poker where you can make a good play that leads to a bad result. Example:\n\nYou have a board of AKJT4 , you 'know' your opponent only has a Queen in this situation 5% of the time. There is 500 in the pot, and you both have 1000 left. You go all in, knowing he will fold 95% of the time and you will win 500 chips, or he will call 5% of the time and you will lose 1000 chips, giving you a net gain of +425 chips. You have 78 (nothing), and go all in. In this specific instance your opponent calls you and you lose, although in an overall strategy this is a good play.\n\nSo my question from our argument is, what ML approaches would be best for tackling this sort of problem and is it likely that the machine would be able to classify individual plays with such depth or would it simply say \"Over the 5M hands that I have seen, making this play in this scenario is associated with a higher winrate than any other play in this scenario\"?\n\n\nThis is not something we're going to be implementing since at the moment it's beyond us but we were curious how the different ML algorithms actually approach this scenario when you can have an action that results in a positive result but is in reality a negative action (and vice versa). Is the solution just that with a large enough sample these things should be weeded out and their true value/worth established?\n\nThanks!

In this example I use the index of a character in a string of all characters as input for each neuron. The input layer has 50 neurons so the text can't be over 50 characters.

I noticed that the amount of GPU memory and processing time needed for a net seems to scale faster than linearly with the number of cells per layer. I *think* it's quadratic because adjacent layers are densely connected; that is, each activation output from an LSTM unit on layer L links to the inputs of *every* LSTM unit on layer L+1. Thus a GPU with more memory and processing power is going to pay pretty limited dividends in terms of scaling the horizontal size of the network.\n\nIf I've got that right, I was wondering if anyone is aware of any example code or other pointers for how to implement sparsely connected LSTM layers -- where each LSTM unit in layer L connects to (say) exactly 256 LSTM units in layer L+1 (chosen randomly upon initialization), such that the GPU memory and computer power required to add another marginal LSTM unit to each layer is (much closer to) constant.\n\nDoes anyone know if that architecture or similar has been successful, or any pointers to implementing it in Torch? I think it probably works to some extent, because I found an oblique comment by Prof. Schmidhuber somewhere to the effect that sparse LSTMs work well, and I have this (quite possibly crackpot) theory that with enough training data, the sophistication of LSTM sequence predictors could grow with their parallel breadth without limit to the point where they could generate ideas and complete arguments rather than phrases and short isolated sentences.

{"selftext":"Hi, after a 10 year break, I've recently gotten back into NNs and machine learning. Since I always liked the idea of creating bots and had toyed with Markov chains before, I was of course intrigued by karpathy's LSTM text generation.\n\nAfter getting past the pybrain stage, I started using keras. I did however not have a lot of success (as opposed to pybrain, which was slow but got me results) - the stateless nature of the LSTM in keras  (refernced [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/keras-users/Y_FG_YEkjXs) among other places) seems to make tasks with LSTM that require the network eating its own output less than elegant. (edit: 'elegant' [explained](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/3dqdqr/keras_lstm_limitations/ct7qi4r))\n\nSince I will want to apply ML to more tasks involving generating sequences of data in the future, I'm looking for a library that will let me do that. Do you guys have any indications where i should turn my attention? I am aware of blocks, passage, lasagne- but I only found out after putting 1 day of work into learning Keras how it didn't really do my case of LSTM well. I'd like to not do that again, so maybe you guys know which of the existing frameworks does what I need well? \n\nI'd prefer a solution that would allow me to leverage my knowledge about the library to other ML areas as well, so something that does 'generating LSTMs' AND other current NN types well would be ideal. And of course theano and the usual state of the art stuff but I assume that's a given by now.","media":null,"ups":17,"retrieved_on":1440604054,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/3dqdqr/keras_lstm_limitations/","downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","distinguished":null,"title":"Keras LSTM limitations","secure_media_embed":{},"created_utc":"1437224055","author_flair_text":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"MachineLearning","domain":"self.MachineLearning","hide_score":false,"edited":1437234594,"score":17,"quarantine":false,"from_id":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/3dqdqr/keras_lstm_limitations/","secure_media":null,"from_kind":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","created":1437227655,"stickied":false,"from":null,"author":"w0nk0","is_self":true,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":32,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"name":"t3_3dqdqr","gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"id":"3dqdqr","archived":false}

This might not be the best example because it obviously is a very difficult task given Liberty Mutual had to crowdsource a solution.\n\nI'm not looking for advice on this particular project - but rather a starting point when given tons of data on how to figure out what's important.\n\nI've used the following techniques in the past when dealing with large amounts of data to get an understanding of importance/impact/influence etc: \n\n* Lasso/Ridge/ElasticNet, \n* PCA, \n* Random Forests, \n* Boosting, \n* Decision Trees, \n* Correlation matrices \n* regressions\n\nBut I've never felt like I might have been doing it in an optimum manner.

In the tensor, not all the \"k\" experiments have all the \"n\" observations available. However, when the observation exists in an experiment, it is guaranteed that all the \"m\" continuous variables are present. It is expected that only a small number of 'm' variables (i.e. no more than 100) are needed to explain a 'p' variable. These 'p' variables are not expected to be completely independent from each other, and the classes can be quite unbalanced in some cases. Moreover, the \"k\" experiments are very different and each one provides information from a different perspective, so I would assume that flattening this X tensor will lead to loss of information.\n\nIn particular, I am interested in constructing a classification model that can explain the 'p' variables (or groups of these variables), and that is interpretable in terms of which variables enter that model, and therefore I am avoiding black-box methods. I would like to reach conclusions of the form \"The set {p_1, ... p_a} of variables from Y can be explained by variables {m_1, ... m_b}, which are more strongly represented on experiments {k_1, ..., k_c}\".\n\nI've been having trouble on how to approach this problem. It looks to me that if X was just a matrix I could use Canonical Correlation Analysis. I have been thinking of performing sparse multiple canonical correlation analysis; or maybe some high order singular value decomposition on the tensor (but I still do not see how to relate the subtensors to the Y matrix of variables...).

After reading a handful of papers/books, I was able to get a simple model built to classify [SMS messages](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection) as either **spam** or **ham** using [Torch7](http://torch.ch).\n\nI've seen quite a bit of discussion on RNNs/LSTMs, and am interested in learning a bit more about how they work. My current understanding is that RNNs are well suited for sequence data. The typical example being *given this sequence of letters, what's the next most likely letter?*. \n\nI'm interested in reframing my toy SMS problem in the context of an LSTM, but am having trouble understanding how RNNs/LSTMs are used for classification.

Call The Mobile Update Co FREE on 08002986030\n\nAnd convert it into a sequence? My current idea is as follows:\n\n* RNN would take N inputs, where N is the number of characters I want to pass in at any given time.\n* Chunk the SMS into several N length parts (e.g. N = 5 would result in chunks *Had y*, *ad yo*, \n*d you*, etc). That is, I would have a window of size N that I would slide down the message. \n* Each window would be passed into the RNN as input - these would serve as my sequences. \n* Whenever I get to the end of a message, if I don't have enough characters I simply fill in any empty slots with a null value.\n* For each window in a message, I'd use the label for the overall message as my target.\n* The network would have two outputs: One for spam, and one for ham.\n\nI feel like a poor understanding on my part is resulting in an over complication.\n\nWhat's wrong with my current idea for my RNN implementation of my toy problem?","permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/3ea4dc/rnn_and_lstms_a_few_questions/","link_flair_text":null}

I've done work backend and frontend work, whether it be for personal projects or paid ventures.\n\nFor a year or so, a physics professor and I have worked together to develop a thesis centered around the mechanical application of neural networks into real-world robotics (basically, we came up with a system that reworks the dynamics of motion and utilizes a self functioning, semi-aware, neural network to command a robotic device). We've devised an intricate series of differential equations and PID-esque formulas and algorithms to back up our research.\n\nWhen it comes to Neural Networks, I nearly understand all theoretical information (I've read a lot and documented myself) but am not sure how to start applying this knowledge into real world, live, programming. Was wondering if anybody could provide some sources for learning material.\n\nEDIT: I already posted this in AskProgramming but the response was quite stale... I reckon the majority of browsing users don't find computational cognitive neuroscience intriguing...","media":null,"ups":0,"retrieved_on":1440594386,"created_utc":"1437639330","author_flair_text":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"MachineLearning","domain":"self.MachineLearning","hide_score":false,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","distinguished":null,"title":"Engineering neural networks: Looking for courses or learning material to get started.","secure_media_embed":{}}

Mostly I have been learning from Andrej Karpathy's char-RNN. I'm making my code public, even though it is a little crappy, because maybe it will be useful to someone! Or at the very least, fun. I'm willing to answer questions about any of the weird stuff I did.\n\nMy background: I am a rising second-year PhD student in machine learning. Still feeling out my research direction, but I am pretty much onboard the whole deep learning thing.\n\nHere's the link:\nhttps://github.com/jachiam/rnn-playground\n\nInstructions for use are in the readme, and clarification is available on request. If you're wondering, yes, it /should/ work, although you may have to tweak your hyperparameters to get good performance on your particular text corpus. For example, here's a sample of text generated from Shakespeare after one epoch of training using all of the default settings except for layer_size (which here is 256; default is 128):\n\n--[[\nere, and; and you wayhings fees.\n\nSAABTREND:\nI angen no these owee To whent' Cimane? that ther is you.\n\nhou shall not and said thine?\n\non might be ill; at by my tout hem?\n\nBASTARD:\nThe foumsst ne conf\n--]]\n\nNot terrible!

(lets put aside the cases of human trafficking, drugs being sold illegaly at the borders...). Isn't it too cruel to consider people as smuggled in case they just simply want to come to the country to work but not having the means to do it in a legal manner ?What is more if such systems are adopted more and more wouldn't they cause illegal immigrants choose more dangerous options (for them) in order to enter the country ?\nAm I just too naive ?","media":null,"ups":0,"retrieved_on":1440589547,"created_utc":"1437848816","author_flair_text":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"MachineLearning","domain":"self.MachineLearning","hide_score":false,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","distinguished":null,"title":"The ethics of automated electronic border surveillance","secure_media_embed":{}}

I train the network one character at a time with the ideal output of the whole sequence. But I think, and it makes sense that it is, causing the training to diverge to infinity. This is because character a or [0.1] is of class 1 in word x, but is of class 4 in word y. The same input can not have two classes, right?\n\nHowever, how else do I do this? The reason I am training one character at a time is so that similar words result in similar classes; for example read and reading. Another reason I am training one character at a time is because I don't know how many words there will be in a input so I have one input neuron. I input each character and the lstm then takes in the whole sequence of vectors with the same class, which is also the last character's class.\n\nIs there a way to do this properly?

I am sure a lot of you have already faced a similar situation :)\n\nThis got me the idea to write a couple of blog posts to explain, with simple words, with a very informal tone and with a lot of examples what was Machine Learning.\n\nIdeally, I hope these posts can explain, to anybody, what the Classification problem is, what is kNN and what is Random Forest. \n\nThe posts are at this address:\n\n* [http://blog.mathieu.guillame-bert.com/2015/07/12/introduction-to-machine-learning/](http://blog.mathieu.guillame-bert.com/2015/07/12/introduction-to-machine-learning/)\n* [http://blog.mathieu.guillame-bert.com/2015/07/20/machine-learning-for-dummies-part-2/](http://blog.mathieu.guillame-bert.com/2015/07/20/machine-learning-for-dummies-part-2/)\n* [http://blog.mathieu.guillame-bert.com/2015/07/23/machine-learning-for-dummies-part-3/](http://blog.mathieu.guillame-bert.com/2015/07/23/machine-learning-for-dummies-part-3/)\n\nI would be happy to hear what do you thing :)\n\nI made some experiment of understanding on my side (notably with my girlfriend), and so far, I am happy with the result.\n\nCheers and thanks,\nM.\n","media":null,"ups":10,"retrieved_on":1440587100,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/3eq797/machine_learning_for_dummies_three_posts_to/","thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"distinguished":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"Machine Learning \u201cfor Dummies\u201d \u2013 Three posts to explain ML to non-scientific peoples","preview":{"images":[{"resolutions":[{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/s4bwOXfV9sk0JocslRem3CFFFT39MM0EMMnDgdkLvz0.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=904ebb27d842fd410bc6343c9a17226e","height":99,"width":108},{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/s4bwOXfV9sk0JocslRem3CFFFT39MM0EMMnDgdkLvz0.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=5420108a113c64213160ba5950de25ee","height":199,"width":216}],"source":{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/s4bwOXfV9sk0JocslRem3CFFFT39MM0EMMnDgdkLvz0.jpg?s=7acada6aa9ee2394f116fbc1a5477e4b","height":267,"width":289},"variants":{},"id":"K6p8JFAI47JA58EHw5jZr15kA94SRmXlXl37LW7ZEKQ"}]},"author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1437965186","subreddit":"MachineLearning","media_embed":{},"hide_score":false,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","score":10,"edited":false,"quarantine":false,"from_id":null,"created":1437968786,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","from_kind":null,"secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/3eq797/machine_learning_for_dummies_three_posts_to/","stickied":false,"from":null,"post_hint":"self","author":"Achoum","is_self":true,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":4,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"name":"t3_3eq797","link_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"id":"3eq797","archived":false}

We then go on to measure the performance of our algorithm by making an ROC curve of false positives verses false negatives, or just state the percentage correct.\n\nHowever, this is not necessarily correct to assume that all the labels in the test set are correct. If the test set isn't vetted well enough, it's reasonable to assume some small percentage of the labels were assigned by mistake. And even further, on some problems, human performance on the test set is not even close to 100%. If people can't even be correct close to all the time, it seems foolish to assume we've got all the labels in the test set correct.\n\nAlso, for a given example, maybe there isn't a label in the dictionary of labels that accurately corresponds to the example. What if (for example) somehow someone drew a smiley and it slipped into a dataset like MNIST on accident? In that case no label would be a correct label.\n\nSo assuming we don't have a perfectly labeled test set, how can we mathematically adjust our performance calculations or interpret them to account for that? If we had a test set with 5% wrong labels (maybe that's extreme, but imagine it), there's probably not really any difference in the performance of an algorithm that got 97% and one that got 99.5%. What are good ways of figuring out what the true accuracy of our labels are? Human evaluation? Multiple human evaluations? If we find incorrect labels in our test set, should we remove the examples and test again?\n\nOf course all these questions probably depend on what problems and datasets your have, how they were constructed, how things are being evaluated... etc. But I'm looking for other people's opinions and anecdotes for what they've done, and other people's thought process on the matter.","media":null,"hide_score":false,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1438043244","subreddit":"MachineLearning","media_embed":{},"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"Label Accuracy","thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"distinguished":null,"stickied":false,"from_id":null,"from_kind":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","created":1438046844,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/3eu76m/label_accuracy/","secure_media":null,"edited":false,"score":4,"quarantine":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"name":"t3_3eu76m","id":"3eu76m","archived":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":1,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"is_self":true,"from":null,"author":"jrkirby"}

After some development I was finally able to train fast r-cnn code on my own datasets, and sure enough it is super fast and pretty accurate. My advice is unless you are a masterful python-ist (and even if you are), set aside some time to really understand and look at his code. In many places it's just bad and you'll have to rewrite it to work with it for your own datasets. All that said, great idea, and great algorithm.\n\nfaster r-cnn just says \"The code will be released\" in the abstract. Instead of waiting for another repo that may also be cryptic and obfuscated, I was just gonna start coding it up myself from my initial edits of fast r-cnn so I can keep the papers flowing.\n\nA questions about it I'd love to hear peoples input on though:\n\n1. Did you find Girshick's code hard to mutate so you could use it or was it just me?\n\n1. At what point do we need to say that test speed isn't worth it for all the extra training? Fast r-cnn only has to be trained once, but the procedure for the faster r-cnn looks like you need to train/finetune 4 different nets? (1- Finetune an imagenet model for objectntness with anchor points on the new dataset, 2- Train a fast r-cnn on the new dataset using the regions proposed by (1), 3- Use the conv layers from (2) on the first model and fix the conv layers, to finetune the fully connected layers, and 4- Finetune the fc layers of (2) with the regions proposed in (3)). After training 4 networks, they can use 300 regions, and go end to end detection in about .2 seconds. In an upcoming paper (probably arxiv), I have found that you can do end to end detection in &lt; 1 second for around 2250 regions).\n\n1.

Thus my main aim is to identify the parameter sets which generate the latent feature which match my target as closely as possible.\n\nThe main issue with this is that certain values of parameters produce simulations from which it is not possible to estimate that latent feature I mentioned (it requires inverting a matrix). As a result, the prediction error is undefined at that parameter value. Consequently the prediction error function has points that are undefined.\n\nMy question is, are there any sensible approaches to dealing with this situation? Currently I just set the error to be artificially large (say, 10000) and hope that the optimisation algorithm learns to ignore those parts of the parameter space.

Now you only have access to the final result, which is smoother because of reduced noise, but also the signal is a bit messed up (due to mistakes that may have been made in the averaging process). How do you then do model inference? \n\nNormally you would project your 3D model and compare it to each pixel individually to create a score (e.g., a likelihood that is a Gaussian distribution centered at each pixel value).
