There was nobody else at the company who did what I did and no real oversight, so I was very self-led.  I did the Andrew Ng course on Coursera, picked up a bunch of O'Reilly books like \"Python for Data Analysis,\" \"Doing Data Science,\" and \"Data Analysis with Open Source Tools.\"\n\nEventually I decided I wanted to move to a company where I could learn from other people.

After a bit of time there, though, I have some misgivings:\n\n- I haven't been asked to use a single ML algorithm; the most mathematically interesting thing I've done is a log-log regression.\n- Even simple approaches I've tried, he's asked me to dumb down - one example, we were examining a collection of metrics to see which one had that largest effect on another metric, and I did a simple multivariate linear regression on a bunch of our historical data just to get an idea of what I was looking at.  He said this was unecessary and to just treat each metric as if it was independent from the others.\n- Almost all analysis that isn't done in the sql query is done in excel, and any visualization we put in our presentations has to be an excel graph \"so we can go back and tweak it easily.\"\n- We spend as much time building powerpoint presentations as we do combing through data\n- We don't use any of the software that I understand most companies are looking for in new hires - Hadoop, Hive, etc.\n\nSo, my question is, is this job really helping me grow my career in data, or am I stuck in a dead end?\n","media":null,"ups":12,"retrieved_on":1441282293,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/29vs6z/is_my_new_job_a_step_forward_or_backwards/"}

I'm working on PhD on social network analysis. At this moment, I'm using TM package for text mining and analysis purposes, with english and arabic languages mixed in bid data sets.\n\nThe data sets are collected from Twitter API with a JAVA program and placed in a MongoDB data base.\n\nFor test purposes, I use a small dataset of 36000 tweets.\n\nThe problem is that for huge datasets computing (&gt;1000000 rows), my MacBookPro would not be sufficient.

I will try to use either logistic regression or SVM for the classification algorithm.\n\nSetting aside the problem of parsing resumes into a structured form, let's assume that for each resume I have information such as name, address, education (university name, degree, major, year of graduation, gpa), work experience (employer name, title, dates worked, description of role), and maybe stuff like descriptions of personal projects that they have worked on and technologies that they have used.\n\nLet's assume that we are training this algorithm for a particular employer and a particular position (because each employer probably looks for different things in a resume). Let's also assume that we have good historical training data (a map of resumes to one of the categories above). Some of the features are obvious such as university names, employer names, job titles, gpa, major, etc. I can also think of keyword based features. For example, I can include a feature based on the keyword  \"JAVA\" (whether job description contains the string \"JAVA\"). I'm not even sure whether adding these keyword based features make sense and beyond that I can't think of anything else to add. I don't know much about NLP so would I be able to make use of some NLP techniques to add features?

I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit for this question. CogSci seems more interested in the philosophical side of Neural Networks, and Neuro is obviously more interested in straight Neuroscience. If you feel this is the wrong subreddit, feel free to ignore this and, mods, please lock it - but in this case, a pointer in the right direction would be great. \n\nA friend and I were introduced to Neural Networks by a professor. I am a Neuroscience student, he is a Computer Science student. For the purposes of curiosity and learning, we have decided to try our hand at them.  He has already made a few with good results. \n\nAt the moment we are building an ANN with a special focus on adherence to known Neuroscience.  Whereas before, we were using some basic positive/negative reinforcement for our learning, now we are looking at more closely modelling synaptic plasticity - probably with some variation of Hebbian Learning. At present, we have implemented Oja's rule, But I was wondering what else where was out there. The Neuroscientist in me bristles at some of the assumptions and foundations of Oja's rule (especially the default 'decaying' of synapatic weight), so I was wondering if there were any papers presenting algorithms more closely based on long-term potentiation and long-term depression. I've been searching via my university library, but it has been fruitless so far. \n\nAny references would be a great help, and thank you in advance.","media":null,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","hide_score":false,"created_utc":"1405080557","author_flair_text":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"MachineLearning","title":"Biologically Plausible Learning Algorithms in ANN's","secure_media_embed":{},"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","distinguished":null}

(i.e. if the model that works well for healthy patients fails miserably for Alzheimer's patients then there is probably a difference)\n\nI guess I will fit the linear regression model on 80% of the healthy patients (the training set), holding back 20% (as a test set) to calculate the MSE with because it seems unfair to calculate the MSE on data that the model was trained on and compare it to a dataset which the model never saw.\n\nI would use cross-validation but then I will end up with as many different sets of coefficients as I have folds and how would I know which to fit the Alzheimer's patients with? The mean of the coefficients perhaps? An advantage to cross validation though is that I would have a mean and standard deviation of the MSE  estimates from the sets of healthy patients so I could use that to determine the significance of deviation between the healthy and diseased MSE's, which is handy.\n\nI guess I could also sample subsets many times from the Alzheimer's patients and create a set of MSE estimates which I could then calculate the standard deviation and mean of to get some idea of the variance there as well so I have an idea about how sensitive it is to that particular dataset.

The target here is a rolling cost measurement, and I also have temporal inputs that describe items that contributed to the cost in the given period. FWIW, the cost variable alone for a specific individual isn't rather informative (i.e. an AR(I)MA on just the cost for just one person wouldn't be insightful). However, there are patterns in cost shared across the entire population, and there are also similar trends in the target-input relationship shared across individuals.\n\nIn addition to the sequential information, for each individual I have another set of data with static features that contain data similar to demographics. This set includes ~100 features. The static and sequential data for each individual are linked.\n\nSo I know there are stats-y kinds of ways to deal with this (hierarchical models, ignoring sequential nature of the data, etc.), but my data violates most of the necessary assumptions. Similarly, I could either ignore the sequential nature of the data and feed it to any of a number of ML models, but through personal experience and domain research, I've found that this results in significant information loss and poor model performance. Likewise, I suppose that I could mash the static data together with the sequential, essentially repeating a demographic characteristic 15 times. That doesn't seem like a good idea from a math point of view.\n\nThus, here's what I'm currently considering: a hybrid HMM-RNN model. The HMM will model the relationship between the static data and the rolling cost, and will have access to cost at t-1 (relatively standard HMM). The RNN- recurrent neural net- will be used to model the relationship between the sequential inputs and the rolling target. As the sequences would be too short to train independently, and it would be illogical to combine all of the sequences into one long one, I'll use a slightly different training method for the RNN. I'll train each sequence (i.e. each individual) separately, then use the final weights for the first individual as the starting weights for the following, and repeat until convergence.\n\nI'd greatly appreciate criticism of my idea, recommendations of different techniques, or paper suggestions. Honestly, I'd be exceedingly grateful for just a hint on search keywords, as I'm at a loss here.","media":null,"ups":0,"retrieved_on":1441266502,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/2at8ns/time_series_question_please_help/","from":null,"author":"fhadley","is_self":true,"num_comments":3,"author_flair_css_class":null,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t3_2at8ns","gilded":0,"id":"2at8ns","archived":true,"edited":false,"score":0,"quarantine":false,"from_id":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/2at8ns/time_series_question_please_help/","secure_media":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","from_kind":null,"created":1405472509,"stickied":false}

Additionally, it's been suggested that k-fold cross-validation produces better results for simpler models such as linear regression. ^[1] . Since my sample size is small, however, I'm not sure how much I can afford to cut out.\n\n\n2. Bagging (bootstrap aggregating) ^[3] .  I've mostly seen this method applied to decision trees, but it's used to avoid overfitting.  \n\n3. Jacknifing to determine the properties of the estimators being derived.  \n\nAdditionally, one interesting property (at least for the datasets used in Zuk et al. ^[2] ) of the Bayesian Networks is that underfitting decays exponentially fast with sample size, whereas overfitting decays as a power of N.  Keeping that in mind, I am trying to decide what methods are most appropriate for my scenario.\n\nSources used:\n\n^1 [FAQs.org: What are cross-validation and bootstrapping?](http://www.faqs.org/faqs/ai-faq/neural-nets/part3/section-12.html)\n\n^2 [Zuk et al. \"On the Number of Samples Needed to Learn the Correct Structure of a Bayesian Network\".](http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1206/1206.6862.pdf)\n\n^3 [Elidan, Gel. \"Bagged Learning Structure of Bayesian Networks\".](http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v15/elidan11a/elidan11a.pdf)\n\n__________________________\n\nI asked this question on [cross-validated](http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/108355/what-are-appropriate-validation-methods-for-a-bayesian-network-model-with-low-sa), although the only response was that leave-one-out cross-validation is preferable to bagging, and the explanation was not super-detailed.","media":null,"ups":18,"retrieved_on":1441262409,"created_utc":"1405699410","author_flair_text":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"MachineLearning","domain":"self.MachineLearning","hide_score":false,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","distinguished":null,"title":"What are appropriate validation methods for a Bayesian network model with low sample size?","secure_media_embed":{},"from_id":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/2b20ct/what_are_appropriate_validation_methods_for_a/","secure_media":null,"created":1405703010,"from_kind":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","stickied":false,"score":18,"edited":false,"quarantine":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":0,"saved":false,"over_18":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"name":"t3_2b20ct","id":"2b20ct","archived":true,"from":null,"author":"SymphMeta","is_self":true}

Each image is represented by a vector of 330 values in [0,1], which sum up to 1.  \n\n(I won't explain what those features represent: it would be useless since they lack a clear meaning. Actually, my goal is to try to explain what does the classifier learn from the set)\n\nMy training set comprises 1500 training samples (hence with a set of corresponding binary labels), with over 5000 test samples.\n\nAs you can see, the dimensionality of the problem is rather high: the data matrix has 1500 rows and 330 columns. Still, I am able to train a linear SVM on 4/5th of the training set, and achieve over 95% accuracy on the remaining 1/5th part of the training set.\n\nI am using LIBLINEAR, with L^2 regularization and L^2 loss function. \n\nI also made sure to not overfit in any way: inside the 4/5ths I perform feature transformation (z-score normalization) and SVM calibration with an additional 5-fold CV.\n\nWhat's more interesting is that the same SVM still achieves around 88% of accuracy over the entire test set, which is almost four times as big as the full training set. Results are very robust to choice of cross-validation set.\n\nWhy does it perform so well, despite the curse of dimensionality? Is it a general (unexpected?) characteristic of SVMs? Also, do I need to do some sort of dimensionality reduction? (bear in mind that it is impossible to put any meaningful probabilistic structure on the features, hence no LDA, QDA, etc.)\n\nMy ansatz is that the classes are truly well-separated, both in the training and in the test set. Still, marginal feature distributions are almost overlapped between classes (although I know that this happens easily, even on R^2), and no feature is particularly dominant over the others, judging by the SVM hyperplane coefficients. However, I would like to rule out the dimensionality effect, to be sure of having obtained a good classifier.\n\nThank you!","media":null}

A test was done 18 months ago when a box of 40 tablets that were pre-installed with hundreds of educational apps and were given to a remote village in Ethiopia who were 100% illiterate. This box of tablets were left there without any guidance or training on how to use them. The village had a large group of children who had never seen modern technology let alone heard the English language however within hours the first child figured out how to turn one of them on. A few minutes later he taught the rest of the kids how to turn theirs on. 2 weeks later the kids were using on average 57 apps each, a few more weeks after that, they were singing the alphabet song and starting to learn how to read and write letters. After 5 months they learnt how to hack Android. \n\nRecently the Global Literacy Project expanded on this test and deployed an additional 600 tablets to 8  locations around the world and they are getting back some really great results. We are now convinced that this approach can work and we are taking it to the next stage by developing an AI \u2014amongst other things\u2014 to guide the child through a completely personalized learning experience that dynamically unfolds as the AI learns more about them. The trick is we need to AI to be on-device as we cannot rely on internet connectivity or the creation of local computing nodes. In addition, because we are ultimately also building it for our kids we don't want their highly personal data sitting on some server or being transferred over the internet where it could be intercepted. \n\n**So the problem is this:** We want the on-device AI to build an increasingly large and personal data set about the learner (E.G. Learner is X age, has X interests, is good at X,Y,Z, is not so good at A,B,C, Has personality traits Q,R,S, works better with X learning style, has completed T,U,V modules \u2026.). In addition, the content the learner is learning from will have an increasingly detailed list of metadata associated with it. (E.G. Content Type: Video, Topic: English Nouns, Level: 1, Related to: X,Y,Z..., prerequisites: Q,R,S) however this metadata will also become increasingly large and complex, through learner generated meta data, and updates from our library. \n\nThe AI will then be tasked with many processes to perform like:\n\n* 1. The AI will need to create a map of the content, similar to the [Khan academy Knowledge map](https://www.khanacademy.org/exercisedashboard) Each learners map may be different as they may all have different content installed on their device, or they may have added custom user generated meta data to a piece of content which affects its position in the map.\n\n* 2. The AI will need to use data it has collected from the user through various interactions, personality tests and their general usage and create dynamic learning plans that constantly need to adapt to the needs, goals and interests of the learner. It will do this by analyzing the personal data of the learner, the meta data of the content, and how the content fits within the relational map of linked content. \n\n* 3. A key focus of this platform is the facilitation of social and collaborative learning. We are using mesh networking technology to link the devices together within the community. The AI\u2019s on the network will communicate with each other \u2014with the permission of the learner\u2014 and match up learning pairs or groups to work on problems together. They will also pair Learner X who may have mastered a concept with Learner B who needs help with that concept.\n\n**Our current strategy:** We intend to start off using almost 100% hard coded recommendation engine type logic then gradually use machine learning to develop these further. The key here is that its not a Big data issue, we calling it a little data issue as we need to gain insights from one users data, on device, and make adjustments locally. \n\nSo this is the challenge, how would you structure a solution and what approaches would you use?\n\nHere is some more information about our project: [www.dev4x.com](http://www.dev4x.com)\n","retrieved_on":1441254617,"ups":0,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/2biax2/artificial_intelligence_used_to_provide_a_10x/","link_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","title":"Artificial Intelligence used to provide a 10X improvement in personalized education using \u2018little data\u2019","secure_media_embed":{},"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"MachineLearning","created_utc":"1406133451","author_flair_text":null,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","hide_score":false}

Or do you see a clear progression from current supervised learning techniques into strong AI reinforcement learning techniques?\n\nThank you for your time!","media":null,"ups":46,"retrieved_on":1441254541,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/2bigsf/why_is_reinforcement_learning_so_rare_here/","downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","distinguished":null,"title":"Why is reinforcement learning so rare here?","secure_media_embed":{},"created_utc":"1406136487","author_flair_text":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"MachineLearning","domain":"self.MachineLearning","hide_score":false}

It's basically a knapsack problem, with a twist.  I've got a set of items (A, B, C,...) each with a known volume (the percentage of the container it will take up).  However, there's another item, X, which often fits in the 'spaces between' other items, but how many X's a container can hold depends on what other items are in the container.  For example, if the container holds 2 A's and 1 B, then I can fit 4 X's.  However, if I add a C to the container, I can now only fit 2 X's.  I have some historical data to work with, so I know in the past the various configurations and how many X's they were able to contain.  Is there a way to construct a model based on this historical data so that I can feed it a proposed consolidation, and get back how many X's such a configuration could contain?  \n\nAny suggestions would be appreciated (even if it's just to tell me I'm on the wrong track and should look into some other-- non-ML-- approach).

Pool sizes are static for the whole season (18 weeks and about 18x6 games/picks). You can't see other people's picks until you have made your pick for that respective game. You can make the same pick as somebody else.\n\n\nThere are two **exclusive** strategies.\n\n* You go really high or really low with your pick and hope you are on the edge of the group of picks. That way if the game ends with a high or low score you get a full point. For example if everyone chooses between 3-12 for the winning margin and you pick 20. If the game ends with a score of 50 then you get 1 point.\n* You try and hit the actual winning margin of the game dead on, thereby increasing your chances of getting a margin point of 0.5 (easier to get, but less points).\n\n[GRAPH:](http://i.imgur.com/cBa9HYq.jpg) This graph shows picks made by a large number of people for a single game. The horizontal axis is the margin, so to the left of 0 is Team A winning, and to the right of 0 is Team B winning. The vertical axis is the amount of people that made that specific pick.\n\n\nAlthough the data has been aggregated, the people are all actually playing in small pools of 5-25 people. You can see based on that graph if I wanted to try and be the closest to a winning margin a good pick would be 17. That would put me on the high side with a low probability of having anyone higher.\n\nWhat is surprising is how people have a tendency to pick certain numbers. I keep seeing people pick the number 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, and 16 way more than other numbers.\n\nSo here is the problem that I want to solve. Given that the bookies say Team A will beat Team B by a margin of X, and given that I have Y other players in my pool, what should my pick be?\n\nWill I be able to solve this with machine learning or statistics if I have enough historic data?\n","media":null,"ups":7,"retrieved_on":1441248135,"author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1406495791","subreddit":"MachineLearning","media_embed":{},"hide_score":false,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"distinguished":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"Machine Learning to aid my Fantasy League Picks","from_id":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","created":1406499391,"from_kind":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/2bvxv6/machine_learning_to_aid_my_fantasy_league_picks/","secure_media":null,"stickied":false,"edited":1406496272,"score":7,"quarantine":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":12,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"gilded":0,"name":"t3_2bvxv6","link_flair_css_class":null,"archived":true,"id":"2bvxv6","from":null,"author":"Arramack","is_self":true}

I've only taken one numerical methods course as an undergrad, but liked it. I also like physics/engineering, so I think this may be a good field for me\n\nI have 3 options to pursue an MS and then a career in computational science. I have no desire to pursue a PhD and work in research as I just want to get into industry asap and work as an engineer/scientist performing simulations and modeling. I also have no desire on working on the Master's thesis but I have no other choice\n\n(1)I was enrolled in a Physics Phd program but took a leave of absence from the program and have been approved to re-enter the grad program starting in the Fall 2014 semester. I could continue with this program and leave after getting the Master's. Even if I don't get the phd, the program will still be funded. Getting the MS should take 2 semester but I have to work on a thesis for both semesters. The school is considered top 20 in physics and top 10 for computational science. However, since most students get a phd and want to continue in academia, my guess is that this program doesn't offer great networking opportunities\n\n(2) I could transfer to a stats or computational science MS program, but I have to wait until Fall 2015 and I would have to pay out-of-state tuition for them. Or I could re-apply to programs where I can pay in-state tuition, but I still have to wait until Fall 2015. Money is not a big issue to me, but this is my least favorite option because I don't want to have a year with nothing to do\n\n(3) My other option is to attend a Computational Science Master's program in Germany that will let me start for the Fall 2014 semester. It would take at least 3 semesters, but I have to spend just 1 semester on a thesis. Funding is not offered but there are NO tuition fees. I applied to Europe because I thought I might like living in Germany for a bit, but I want the MS degree to be beneficial to me in the US in case I wanted to return in the future. Since I just want a good job after I graduate and don't want to get into research, I don't really care if RWTH Aachen has good research or not\n\n\nWould I be at a serious disadvantage when applying for jobs against other Computational Science MS holders even if the thesis for my MS in Physics involves lots of numerical methods (such as numerical PDEs)? What kinds of careers could I get into? What grad courses should I take other than numerical PDEs?\n\nOr should I just spend 3 semesters for the program in Germany?\n\nAre computational scientists just as passionate about programming as software engineers are?","media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/2bwb0j/career_in_scientific_computing_with_ms_in_physics/","secure_media_embed":{},"title":"Career in Scientific Computing with MS in Physics?","thumbnail":"default","downs":0,"distinguished":null,"hide_score":false,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1406504254","subreddit":"MachineLearning","media_embed":{}}

However, to start off I am currently using random forests to classify network activity. When you can provide training data for and label all categories, everything is fine. However, problems arise when we transfer the problem away away from the model into the real world. Here it is impossible to provide data for all types of activity due to the huge variety that exists.\n\nAt the moment our attempt is to label large amounts of network activity we're not interested in as \"other\" in the training set, which works to some degree.

{"media":null,"selftext":"Full disclosure: this post is plugging work I contributed to, but I think it will be of interest to this community.\n\nIn collaboration with the University of Trento ([Georgiana Dinu](http://clic.cimec.unitn.it/~georgiana.dinu/)), [Oxford's Computational Linguistics Group](http://www.clg.ox.ac.uk/), (namely [Phil](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/phil.blunsom/), [Karl](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/karlmoritz.hermann/) and [Ed](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/edward.grefenstette/)) has put together a tutorial for this year's ACL, which took place in Baltimore. \n\nThis tutorial, *New Directions in Vector Space Models of Meaning* (pun not intended), covers a variety of topics relating to the theme of representation learning for semantics. We discuss neural language models in depth, neural models of composition, deep learning, and the application of convolutional neural networks to natural language processing. Because of the growing popularity of these topics in the NLP community, the tutorial was the most well attended tutorial at this year's conference.\n\nThe tutorial does not pre-suppose much prior knowledge of machine learning beyond basic linear algebra and log-linear models, or any complex knowledge of NLP. The slides are meant to be fairly self-contained, and provide all (or most) of the maths required to implement the models we describe. We also discuss some training and architectural tricks and \"black magic\" that most people use when applying these models.\n\nThe slides for the tutorial can be found [on our group's resource page](http://www.clg.ox.ac.uk/resources) (apologies for typos), and the video of the tutorial, lovingly aligned with the slides by yours truly (6+ hours of painful labour and checking), [has just been uploaded to youtube](http://youtu.be/_ASOqXiWBVo) (we apologise for the cruddy quality of the image/sound, but we had to film this ourselves, rather than professionally).\n\nWe hope you enjoy our tutorial.","retrieved_on":1441243990,"ups":45,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/2c4p2m/acl14_tutorial_on_machine_learning_for_nlp/","link_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null,"thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"ACL'14 Tutorial on Machine Learning for NLP","subreddit":"MachineLearning","media_embed":{},"author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1406716602","hide_score":false,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","quarantine":false,"edited":1406732129,"score":45,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","created":1406720202,"from_kind":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/2c4p2m/acl14_tutorial_on_machine_learning_for_nlp/","secure_media":null,"from_id":null,"stickied":false,"author":"egrefen","from":null,"is_self":true,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"num_comments":7,"author_flair_css_class":null,"id":"2c4p2m","archived":true,"name":"t3_2c4p2m","gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null}
