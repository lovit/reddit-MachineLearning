Maybe it's been done already or perhaps not, but I've been studying how to build a compiler lately and I was wondering if it would be an interesting idea to pursue designing a language specifically designed to facilitate the various fields of machine learning.  And if it were the case that a real need would be fulfilled by designing said language, what would people want?  What would folks like emphasized?  There are tons of languages out there but would the field of machine learning truly benefit from a tailor made language, especially one made with direct input from those in the field of machine learning?  Heck, would it be a good idea to make it open to the pubic in terms of design?

That's a good one but once again too many \" The proof goes beyond of this book \" So frustrating ...\n\nFinally I took the Linear dynamical system course from standford.

SURF and SIFT are really out due to patents (also I believe the main advantage of these are scaling and rotation invariance) which I don't realy need.\n \n**EDIT:** [Confusion Matrix](http://imgur.com/FNqFaKQ)\n\n","retrieved_on":1441929072,"ups":9,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/1wzv2p/i_need_some_help_finding_features_xpost_from/","link_flair_text":null}

We're using elastic search as a base tool and then a host of ML techniques to make the system perform better. I'm curious as to how large our sample would need to be to be representative of the 5 billion strings that need to be processed. \n\nMy thoughts are that we could use scikit learn to turn the strings into tokens and see the distribution of those tokens. My thought is, as more strings are loaded in, the distribution of the more common tokens will stabilize. Eventually, new tokens that are found will amount to less than 1% of the tokens that have been found so far, and at that point we should be able to say that however many strings that have been loaded in is a good representative example of the variation in the data.\n\nWhat do you guys think?

Or something very similar.\n\nBut here is the problem - ideally I would like outputs being produced by doing something to a subset of inputs. However many times I need to save intermediate results to outputs (since they take a long time to compute) and then use those. So the flow starts to go from outputs to outputs. (which irks me a little, because every time I change something it becomes harder to track which parts need to be redone.\n\nIn addition I like doing some kind of presentation/graphics/description of the results each time I finish some part. And I am having trouble deciding where to put those. One idea is associate every output folder with some kind of result - which makes the individual folders of outputs more complicated and unique. Another possibility is having a separate folder like \"results\". But computing something in output and then having to do something in a different folder for \"presentation\" also bothers me a little. And what's worse is that \"results\" folder get's cluttered really fast in practice, if the project is running for a longer period of time.\n\nSo this is my rant and some minor issues which for some reason effect the productivity of what I do. It seems important yet I can find no literature or any suggestions to formally address these things.\n\nCan someone with a similar situation share how they are organizing their work and what works/does not work in practice?\n\nOr better yet - suggest some literature (if there is any) addressing this?\n\n**EDIT:** Seems like this thread quickly got nowhere, I guess people are not into these kinds of things.

Make a copy of the sequence, randomly change one of the symbols to corrupt the context, and concatenate those representations to make x_hat. For each input vector, compute a scalar score by doing one feed-forward pass and taking the dot product with an arbitrary vector. (At least I think it's arbitrary, they make no mention of it anywhere, input here is welcome). The score of x is S(x), and for x_hat it's S(x_hat).\n \nFeatures are then learnt by optimizing a hinge loss: J = max(0, 1 - S(x) + S(x_hat))\n \nI'm trying to implement it from the slides for a related toy problem, but I'm curious about a few things: when you back-propagate unlabeled information, why would you also change the network weights? Aren't we purely interested in learning features that make S(x) &gt; S(x_hat) by some margin? \n \nThe next step in the process is back-propagating label information into the representations by using a softmax output layer. Again, what is the point of also changing the weights if we only care about representations? Wouldn't we purely want to optimize representation vectors to result in correct classification, and then do weight learning separately at some later time? \n \nThanks a bunch.

But my neural net is **not** being trained properly. The original paper by Tesauro [could be found here](http://neumre-2011-projekt.googlecode.com/svn-history/r37/trunk/literatura/tesauro1995temporal.pdf). \n\nHere's my setup and the problem:\n\nThe input is a vector of length 43, i.e. status of the 6-times-7 board and the next player. The output layer has 3 neurons standing for the chance of \"the first player will win\", \"this game will be a draw\", and \"the second player will win\" respectively. After randomly initialize the weight, this net will play a game with itself, then learn from this game.\n\nAccording to the original learning algorithm, we will just focus on decreasing the difference between two *ply*s, and decrease the difference between the prediction and the true outcome of this game only in the end. The last step indicates the proper direction to train the weight. However, After about 100 games, I find out that the output values look like [0.99,0.05,0.99], i.e., in order to decrease the difference between two *ply*s, the neural net chose to **fix its output** and ignore the last outcome. I thought this was caused by insufficient training, but the output will still fix to the [1,0,1] even after thousands of games.\n\nI think there could be some reasons:\n\n* I am doing it in a totally wrong way\n* I chose a wrong game to play(connect four)\n* I need to tune parameters\n* The tutorial is misleading\n* I need to increase the penalty of the last step\n\n\n* Or , in the paper [*Why did TD-Gammon Work?*](http://foogammonz.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Why_did_TD_Gammon_work.pdf) by Jordan B. Pollack &amp; Alan D. Blair:\n&gt; It (Tesauro's TD-Gammon) has not led to similar impressive breakthroughs in temporal difference learning for other applications or even other games.\n\nDoes anybody has experiences on this topic?

The scoring is the same as in the original implementation (+1 for every frame of life, -1000 for death) so a score of -945 corresponds to just falling to your death, -730 corresponds to passing the first pipe, and then it's another 200 or so per pipe after that.  I've only got 1 trial for each rule in the top plot, but a lambda of 0.5 reliably gets to well over 1000 pipes passed in under 150 games.\n\nBelow that are three plots showing a few different views of the learned Q function for different learning rules; top to bottom are: the original Q-learning with alpha=0.7, Q-lambda with lambda=0.5, and Q-lambda with lambda=0.7.  The leftmost in each is the greedy policy; red means do nothing, green means click/jump, and black is 'nothing learned' and will default to 'do nothing'. Next is the difference in score between clicking and not clicking.  Third is the score for 'clicks' in each state, and last is the score for 'do nothing' in each state.  Important note: because of the way coordinates get stored, the bird actually moves from right to left across these (see the outline of the pipe on the left).  \n\nIt's interesting to compare the Q-learning with Q-lambda; things that jumped out at me:\n\n1. they both sort of settle on the same general strategy (cruise just below the pipe edge, and then hop over it when you get close)\n2. the eligibility traces in the Q-lambda rule let it update values in a much broader space; it's actually managed to assign positive scores to 'do nothing' in a noticeably larger range above the lip of the pipe.  The standard Q-learning can only back out one step at a time, so it ends up taking longer to fill out the space.\n3. The Q-learning has learned a lot more negative values for clicking than the Q-lambda (at least the 'good' Q-lambda one), especially right up against the lower pipe.  The slow backout means that it gets itself into unwinnable positions a lot more readily, resulting in it getting a lot of experience about what not to do, that it then takes a while to learn from, since it can only back out one step from where it's most recently visited.\n\nThe bottom-most plot I find curious; this shows the Q-function for lambda=0.7 in Q-lambda learning.  When you run it, the bird crashes a few times, and then around the 10th or 11th game, suddenly decides that the top of the board is the best place to be, and never seems to learn to come down from there (I've run it for ~1000 games, and never had it get past the first pipe).  Once in a long while it will decide to drop to its death, but it never seems to try clicking mid-drop.  Looking at the plot, it's clearly learned that what it's doing isn't working, since the scores are all red in the two rightmost visualisations, and looking at the difference it seems like the scores are roughly balanced until it gets close to the pipe, but then for some reason it seems to think that clicking is on balance less negative than not clicking.\n\nThe high lambda may be making it \"overthink\" cause and effect, and so update traces that aren't actually relevant, perhaps?  I'm still not satisfied with the answer.\n\nAt any rate, hope someone finds it interesting.","media":null,"ups":14,"retrieved_on":1441901992,"created_utc":"1393030505","author_flair_text":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"MachineLearning","domain":"self.MachineLearning","hide_score":false,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","distinguished":null,"title":"Visualising the Q-function for the RL Flappy Bird hack (link in text)","secure_media_embed":{}}

The next semester I plan on taking topology and stochastic processes.  \n\nMy question is this: if you could pick any advanced math courses to help with where machine learning is and where it is going, what would you take? Learning math is a lot easier for me when I know that I will be using it eventually. I have been studying measure theory independently with a professor over the last semester, so I am worried that intermediate real analysis will be boring to me (not because it is easy, but because it will be irrelevant to ML) -- are there topics in analysis I should study independently other than measure theory? I haven't encountered enough higher level ML literature/articles that actively involve analysis, even though I am told that it comes up (and it makes sense that it would, given the optimization-based nature of ML and analysis's relation to probability theory).  \n\nAnyway, I figure that this thread can serve two purposes: 1) To discuss which math classes are important in ML/higher level ML (besides basic linear algebra, calculus, and probability) and 2) To discuss the importance of analysis in ML \n\nThanks in advance.

The app I've been working on has the following characteristics and goals:\n\n* App crawls websites, stores HTML data\n* A document model is produced from each page crawled, based on the non-markup text content of the page\n* A classifier provides a relevancy prediction of the crawled HTML content, indicating the likely relevance to our client's core business, along with some kind of accuracy scale to indicate degree of relevance\n* Subset of pages crawled from unrecognized domains are presented to users for eventual review, wherein they manually extract relevant features and record the supervised relevancy classification\n* Review data is fed back into the ML algorithm which should learn from the supervised classifications and hopefully improve accuracy over time\n\nConstraints: \n\n* Potentially large set of documents (still in testing and we have over 2 million pages, this will explode once we turn the whole pipeline on full-time) to classify\n* ML process needs to be parallelizable, i.e. multiple machines will potentially be handling the learning _and_ prediction steps of the pipeline\n* Updating the prediction model shouldn't require access to the entire corpus at once; it's possible to have the whole thing (or subset) available for initial training, but over time the additions to the corpus dataset will be streamed into the pipeline\n* Latency is a concern, though we have some wiggle-room here; a few seconds for prediction is acceptable, and that has to include transforming raw HTML content into an appropriate document model\n* Most importantly, updating the predictive model should require as little specialized developer interaction as possible; the app is intended to be a turn-key solution for our client, they have very-little in-house development capability, and we don't want to be on the hook for completely retraining their predictive models every month or two\n\nSo far, I've considered:\n\n* Solr running on dedicated node + lucene classification API\n* VW running on dedicated node in daemon mode performing online updates to the predictor model\n* Cloud-based classification service like Alchemy API, et al\n\nThe cloud-based stuff is nice because we're a very small shop developing this app, and having a \"magic classification box\" would cut down on engineering and deployment overhead. However, they don't provide enough control/visibility into the classification process, as well as being too expensive.\n\nSolr seems like a good approach, but we're wary of the complexity involved in setting up, administering, scaling, and interacting with the Solr stack. We don't currently want or need the ability to search the crawled data, so it seems like a lot of unnecessary overhead just for a binary text classification task. Assuming it scales, though, this approach does neatly solve the parallelization issue (each pipeline node can query the Solr server for both updates and predictions).\n\nVW seems like it would be ideal for this application, but I'm not sure I'm \"doing it right\". Official documentation seems pretty sparse, and I've read lots of blog/forum/mailing-list posts which offer wildly varying approaches.\n\nTo wit:\n\n1. If I run VW in daemon mode, will it handle concurrent streaming updates to the predictor? Can I use the same running daemon for both update and prediction operations?\n2. If I use the daemon mode, do I just need to write plain ASCII-formatted examples to the socket daemon socket? Will unicode data work? How do read response data back?\n3. Because I don't have a full corpus available, I can't do TF-IDF weighting. Some VW examples I've seen suggest that this isn't necessary. Stemming and stopwords seem like useful pre-processing steps to produce the document model, but apparently VW can do n-grams automatically. What would seem a likely effective document model for an arbitrary website based solely on the content and URL?\n4. If I want VW to update the final predictor in a streaming, online fashion, what's the proper VW command-line invocation? They just added the ```--save_resume``` feature, does that do what I want?\n\nUltimately, the predictions don't have to be extremely precise (both false pos/neg predictions are fine to a degree), but we need the system to scale as the corpus grows and be pretty low-maintenance in the long run. \n\nIf anyone out there has any insight about how best to implement a system like this, I'd very much appreciate it. Does Solr or VW make more sense here? Or something else? If VW is the way to go, can anyone provide a specific example demonstrating how to best process and format an HTML document into a valid VW example, train the predictor using VW daemon, and then perform a classification prediction (returning the classification along with some kind of accuracy metric) using VW? That would be incredibly helpful.","media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/1yxz62/can_anyone_give_feedback_on_an_approach_to_online/","title":"Can anyone give feedback on an approach to online HTML document classification?","secure_media_embed":{},"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","distinguished":null,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","hide_score":false,"created_utc":"1393375302","author_flair_text":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"MachineLearning"}
