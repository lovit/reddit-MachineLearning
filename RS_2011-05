I've just finished my first week, and have:\n\n* Read a bunch of online material to get an overview of data mining.\n\n* Read several chapters from [*Data Mining* by Witten and Frank](http://www.amazon.com/Data-Mining-Practical-Techniques-Management/dp/0120884070/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1305991819&amp;sr=1-2).\n\n* Played with WEKA, mostly to learn how to use it. (And sworn at the ARFF file format).\n\n* Worked a bit with MS SQL Server and Excel PowerPivot.\n\n* Installed Excel's Data Mining plugin.\n\nThere's a *lot* of data for the project, but I myself have downloaded and am working with six databases, each of which has approximately six million rows. It's about some pretty complex engines, and has several years' worth of readings from several dozen sensors. I think it's supposed to be tied to events (engine turns on, turns off, overheats, fails, etc.) but that column is blank.\n\nRecently, I had the following conversation:\n\n&gt;Me: I have all the software installed and more-or-less know how to use it. So...what am I supposed to be *doing*?\n\n&gt;Boss: Oh, just play around with the databases and see what you learn.\n\n&gt;Me: Well, I started doing that, but I feel like I can't really discover anything useful without having the readings tied to events...\n\n&gt;Boss: No, there's a lot you can learn without the events.\n\n&gt;Me: I mean, while learning WEKA I made really trivial observations, like, \"The temperature and pressure have a strong positive correlation\", but--\n\n&gt;Boss: No, that's a good thing to know!\n\n&gt;Me: Oh, well, um, okay.\n\nFor reference, here's a simplified version of the data I have:\n\n\nTimestamp| SensorID  | Value | Unit\n----------|----------|---     |\n1/1/01 0:01| 1          | 478    | PSI\n1/1/01 0:01| 2          | 50 | Ft/sec\n1/1/01 0:01| 3          | 0 | 0=off; 1=on\n1/1/01 3:23| 1          | 485 | PSI\n1/1/01 3:23| 2          | 55 | Ft/sec\n1/1/01 3:23| 3          | 1 | 0=off; 1=on\n\n\nAnd here are my problems:\n\n* I have a number of issues with actually manipulating the data into a useful form. I can figure it out eventually, it's just not streamlined at all. If you're interested, [here](http://pastebin.com/mj4epk8N)'s a description.\n\n* I feel like I'm obsessing over stuff like my ARFF files just because I'm not actually sure what I'm going to do with them once they've actually been loaded into WEKA. It's also a much easier problem to solve, and tricks me into feeling productive when I do solve it.\n\n* My boss told me to read up on Naive Bayesian classifiers, which I did, so I'm probably the most knowledgeable about how to classify stuff. However, as far as I know, I have no classes in which to put stuff (if I had the EventIDs, I'd imagine it'd be massively useful to be able to classify things into events...) I'm actually a bit unsure about what I *could* do...I guess I could make a model to predict the reading of one sensor based on the readings of the other--but when would that be useful? If you can get all but one reading, odds are you can get the last one too. I guess I could also try to predict stuff based on the previous readings (which would probably be useful, actually)...but without knowing if the engine is on or off or whatever, I'm guessing it wouldn't be as accurate as one would hope.\n\n* Ooh, I guess I could discretize everything, and *then* I could classify stuff, right? Is this a good idea?\n\nSo I'm unclear about what my objective is, and I have only a shallow knowledge about how to achieve any objective I might have.\n\nIn case it's useful--I *do* know how to program (in Python, Java (I even have a Real Job doing Java development), and Lisp (I won prizes for a pretty cool genetic algorithm that generates AIs for games)), I took AP Statistics (which so far has not been remotely useful, unfortunately). I'm just quite clearly in very new territory (and don't get me wrong--I'm really happy to be learning new things. It's just pretty uncomfortable, too.)\n\nSo I'm sorry if this has been kinda long and unfocused. I'm just overwhelmed and am hoping that you guys will have some words of wisdom.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n\n---------------\n\nTL; DR - I have a stack of data that I'm supposed to get information from. The data is readings from sensors on a large engine (and thus has the pressure, temperature, and other parameters from several different locations) taken periodically over the course of several years. There is no *specific* thing I'm trying to find out. I think it'd be useful to be able to take a set of readings and predict the next one, but that's just me--I could be wrong. Rather than blindly running promising-looking algorithms and seeing what happens, I'd like suggestions on what I should be looking for. I'd rather have an objective and then select a method based on it than do it the other way around.","domain":"self.MachineLearning","num_comments":10,"likes":null,"clicked":false,"thumbnail":"self","saved":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","ups":31,"approved_by":null,"score":26,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a high school senior, and for my senior project I&amp;#39;m spending 3-4 weeks working at a company that does data mining.

So...what am I supposed to be &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Boss: Oh, just play around with the databases and see what you learn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Well, I started doing that, but I feel like I can&amp;#39;t really discover anything useful without having the readings tied to events...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Boss: No, there&amp;#39;s a lot you can learn without the events.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: I mean, while learning WEKA I made really trivial observations, like, &amp;quot;The temperature and pressure have a strong positive correlation&amp;quot;, but--&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Boss: No, that&amp;#39;s a good thing to know!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Oh, well, um, okay.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For reference, here&amp;#39;s a simplified version of the data I have:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Timestamp| SensorID  | Value | Unit\n----------|----------|---     |\n1/1/01 0:01| 1          | 478    | PSI\n1/1/01 0:01| 2          | 50 | Ft/sec\n1/1/01 0:01| 3          | 0 | 0=off; 1=on\n1/1/01 3:23| 1          | 485 | PSI\n1/1/01 3:23| 2          | 55 | Ft/sec\n1/1/01 3:23| 3          | 1 | 0=off; 1=on&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And here are my problems:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a number of issues with actually manipulating the data into a useful form. I can figure it out eventually, it&amp;#39;s just not streamlined at all. If you&amp;#39;re interested, &lt;a href=\"http://pastebin.com/mj4epk8N\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s a description.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel like I&amp;#39;m obsessing over stuff like my ARFF files just because I&amp;#39;m not actually sure what I&amp;#39;m going to do with them once they&amp;#39;ve actually been loaded into WEKA. It&amp;#39;s also a much easier problem to solve, and tricks me into feeling productive when I do solve it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;My boss told me to read up on Naive Bayesian classifiers, which I did, so I&amp;#39;m probably the most knowledgeable about how to classify stuff. However, as far as I know, I have no classes in which to put stuff (if I had the EventIDs, I&amp;#39;d imagine it&amp;#39;d be massively useful to be able to classify things into events...) I&amp;#39;m actually a bit unsure about what I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; do...I guess I could make a model to predict the reading of one sensor based on the readings of the other--but when would that be useful? If you can get all but one reading, odds are you can get the last one too. I guess I could also try to predict stuff based on the previous readings (which would probably be useful, actually)...but without knowing if the engine is on or off or whatever, I&amp;#39;m guessing it wouldn&amp;#39;t be as accurate as one would hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ooh, I guess I could discretize everything, and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; I could classify stuff, right? Is this a good idea?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m unclear about what my objective is, and I have only a shallow knowledge about how to achieve any objective I might have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In case it&amp;#39;s useful--I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; know how to program (in Python, Java (I even have a Real Job doing Java development), and Lisp (I won prizes for a pretty cool genetic algorithm that generates AIs for games)), I took AP Statistics (which so far has not been remotely useful, unfortunately). I&amp;#39;m just quite clearly in very new territory (and don&amp;#39;t get me wrong--I&amp;#39;m really happy to be learning new things. It&amp;#39;s just pretty uncomfortable, too.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m sorry if this has been kinda long and unfocused. I&amp;#39;m just overwhelmed and am hoping that you guys will have some words of wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL; DR - I have a stack of data that I&amp;#39;m supposed to get information from. The data is readings from sensors on a large engine (and thus has the pressure, temperature, and other parameters from several different locations) taken periodically over the course of several years. There is no &lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt; thing I&amp;#39;m trying to find out. I think it&amp;#39;d be useful to be able to take a set of readings and predict the next one, but that&amp;#39;s just me--I could be wrong. Rather than blindly running promising-looking algorithms and seeing what happens, I&amp;#39;d like suggestions on what I should be looking for. I&amp;#39;d rather have an objective and then select a method based on it than do it the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","created":1305998334,"hidden":false,"over_18":false}
