Some of my co-workers did this one last year and really enjoyed it.\n\nFinally, after the \"Computing for Data Analysis\" course above ends, there is a course which appears to be a continuation with applications in analysis of real world data:\n\n[Data Analysis](https://www.coursera.org/course/dataanalysis)\nStarts Oct 13th.\nThis course is an applied statistics course focusing on data analysis. The course will begin with an overview of how to organize, perform, and write-up data analyses.\n\nAnyone else going to follow along in any of these courses?

I am fairly new to machine learning.  I have a small dataset of 90 items and am running a simple binary classification on it.  It is not possible to get that data set any larger as it is running on real world events that only happen a few times a year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That being said, I can&amp;#39;t find a solution on google to this.  If I am running k-fold cross-validation on this data, what is the optimal number of folds to use?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Should I use 90-fold (aka leave one out)?  1x10 folds, 10x10 folds, 100x10 folds, 5x2folds, 2x5 folds?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","retrieved_on":1411786607,"edited":false,"report_reasons":null,"distinguished":null,"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","over_18":false,"id":"1n3itu","num_comments":4,"user_reports":[],"media_embed":{},"gilded":0,"secure_media_embed":{},"domain":"self.MachineLearning","permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/1n3itu/best_number_of_folds_on_crossvalidation_for_a/","score":6}
