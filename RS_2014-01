In a nutshell, and simplifying things a bit: for diabetics glucose levels have to be controlled manually. Eating carbohydrate / sugar raises blood glucose levels, and injecting insulin lowers. So if blood glucose is a 5.6mmol/l and 50g of carbs are eaten, 5u of insulin might be taken to balance out the carbs.\n\nIn practice, the ratios between carbs and insulin is different at different times of day, and drifts over time. Diabetics have to discover these ratios, and when the effects of doses change, have to review and revise them.\n\nAlso as well as doses with meals, there's a long acting (24 hour) daily injection of insulin taken that provides a background. There's a rule of thumb that this should be 60% of the total daily doses. This prevents levels from changing too much at meals - a small miscalculation can have a large effect, and if blood sugar goes too high or low, there can be difficult consequences.\n\nSo, I'm curious how this might be modelled. Ideally, a model would provide a way to recommend optimal ratios and detect changes in ratios, also it'd suggest when to check blood sugar - tests are done manually, typically between 4 and 8 times a day.\n\nFinally, a disclaimer, because I feel I should say this. I'm just curious about how the machine learning community would look at this. I'm not seeking medical advice, and will not treat any information or thoughts shared as medical advice.\n","media":null,"ups":9,"retrieved_on":1441976428}
{"selftext":"Does anyone know what the state-of-the-art is for composite ML problems that involve both classification and labeling sub-tasks? For instance in computer vision, classifying images into one of several categories of scenes and then detecting relevant objects in the image depending on its class. Or classifying emails into predefined topic labels and extracting relevant info (calendar events, contacts, ...) depending on the topic. The obvious approach is to solve each task in sequence but then cascading errors become a problem. Ensemble methods can combine and optimize the local results of each subtask, but at the cost of introducing another layer on top of everything. I wonder if there is some other clever approach out there for performing different ML tasks like classification and extraction on the same object in a more principled way.","media":null,"ups":4,"retrieved_on":1441976325,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/1u88ns/algorithms_for_joint_classification_and_extraction/","thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"distinguished":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"Algorithms for joint classification and extraction?","author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1388670183","subreddit":"MachineLearning","media_embed":{},"hide_score":false,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","score":4,"edited":false,"quarantine":false,"from_id":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","from_kind":null,"created":1388670183,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1u88ns/algorithms_for_joint_classification_and_extraction/","secure_media":null,"stickied":false,"from":null,"author":"lommie","is_self":true,"num_comments":5,"author_flair_css_class":null,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"name":"t3_1u88ns","link_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"id":"1u88ns","archived":true}

It has some problems with subject-verb agreement and singular versus plural nouns, but I'm pretty happy with the results overall. Lots of good examples like \n\n* \"low-rank tensors via ensemble-of-forests models defined on sparse principal graphs\"\n* \"Ground metric learning networks with grouped variables\"\n* \"diffusion process regression trees on time series\"\n* \"domain adaptations for gaussian process state-space inference as iterated conditional probability\"\n\nI then let the same code loose on some titles from my other field of study (ecology).  The results tended to make less sense, but had the potential to be much funnier.  A few of my favorites:\n\n* a fixed motor boat noise affects larval tolerance of tiger (panthera uncia) in daphnia magna\n* Dinosaur radiation and testing for two-dimensional agar plates for flyway\n* demographic and electric field collected aedes aegypti and arsenic alters the fire in a virus\n* repeating patterns of gelatinous plankton communities affect seasonal and endangered species\n\nAnyway, I thought some of you might be amused by the titles and others might enjoy taking a look at the code I used (below).  The code is *not* heavily optimized, since I was working with very small corpora, but it still counts all the bigrams in a few minutes on my laptop.\n\n-----\nGitHub page with source code, titles, and bigram data: https://github.com/davharris/Titlebot\n\nTwitter account for machine learning: https://twitter.com/ML_Titles\n\nTwitter account for ecology: https://twitter.com/EcologyTitles","media":null,"ups":3,"retrieved_on":1441970627,"author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1389040572","subreddit":"MachineLearning","media_embed":{},"hide_score":false,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"distinguished":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"\"tightening mrf relaxations really solve sparse coding\": randomly-generated machine learning paper titles (with code)","from_id":null,"from_kind":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","created":1389040572,"secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ukbo5/tightening_mrf_relaxations_really_solve_sparse/","stickied":false,"edited":1389043425,"score":3,"quarantine":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"num_comments":2,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"name":"t3_1ukbo5","link_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"id":"1ukbo5","archived":true,"from":null,"author":"DavidJayHarris","is_self":true}

To my knowledge, there is no Python analogue of this command when the inputs are character values. \n\nThis led me to try and make the character vector a numeric (the most obvious solution), but I soon discovered this was non-trivial (at least, that's what my initial research has suggested). In R, it's relatively easy to convert a categorical variable into a numeric one by the following:\n\n       &gt; x &lt;- c('IL','AL','NY','MA','CA')\n       &gt; is.character(x)\n       [1] TRUE\n       &gt; x &lt;- as.numeric(factor(x))\n       &gt; x\n       [1] 3 1 5 4 2\n\nYou'll notice that R turns the categories into integers based on their alphabetic order. \n\nSo, I have two questions:\n\n1: Is there a function that automatically creates a series of variables (stored in two ways: character or numeric) and automatically maps them to a sparse matrix?\n\n2: Is there a quick function that can take a character vector and map it to a numeric vector in the same way that I have shown above?\n\nI suppose I could code this function myself, but I thought that I would likely be reinventing the wheel and so I thought I would consult all of you before poisoning myself with a Python bite.\n\nThank you in advance.","media":null,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","hide_score":false,"created_utc":"1389122258","author_flair_text":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"MachineLearning","title":"Question on Sparse Matrix Factorization in Python","secure_media_embed":{},"downs":0,"thumbnail":"self","distinguished":null}

What would be a good way of representing the time of day? I can think of a number of options ranging from simple to complex, but I'm not experienced with NNs, so I don't know if an elaborate solution will give better results.\n\nHere's a few ideas that I've thought of:\n\n* Use an input which slowly increases from zero to one over 24 hours and then falls back to zero. \n\n* Represent time as a position on a unit circle using two inputs, sin(\u03b8) and cos(\u03b8). Travel around the circle once per day.\n\n* Use an array of inputs evenly distributed around the clock, which become more activated the closer the time is to the input's assigned time. E.g. The 2pm input could transition from 0.0 at 12pm to 0.50 at 1pm, 1.0 at 2pm, back down to 0.5 at 3pm, etc. This is linear, but I could also imagine using a Gaussian.\n\nIdeally, I'd like to use a method that allows the NN to recognize short periods of time where events happen frequently (e.g. an event usually occurs 6:30 to 7:00, but rarely between 7:30 and 8:00), while still being able to recognize other patterns that span several hours.\n\n\u2628 Specifically, whether the coffee maker in my house will be used at least once during the next 30 minutes. The coffee maker can be switched off to save energy or switched on to save time (by pre-heating water). The ANN will supply a probability and a cost function will be used to make the decision. An Arduino will switch the coffee maker on and off and sense when the machine is used.","retrieved_on":1441966020,"ups":11,"subreddit":"MachineLearning","media_embed":{},"author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1389305276","hide_score":false,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","distinguished":null,"thumbnail":"self","downs":0,"secure_media_embed":{},"title":"How do you represent time-of-day in artificial neural networks?","from_kind":null,"created":1389305276,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1utxnk/how_do_you_represent_timeofday_in_artificial/","secure_media":null,"from_id":null,"stickied":false,"quarantine":false,"edited":false,"score":11,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"num_comments":18,"author_flair_css_class":null,"id":"1utxnk","archived":true,"name":"t3_1utxnk","link_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"author":"jetRink","from":null,"is_self":true}

So I have the following details: \n\n* 1) the Buyer's name \n* 2) the Shipping Company they will use \n* 3) an identifier for the order \n* 4) a discount identifier\n* 5) a comment.\n\nLife would be easy if 1) was filled out exactly the same each time. The problem is, that there are many naming variations (i.e. Microsoft vs Microsoft Inc vs Microsoft Inc. vs Microsoft Incorporated vs Microsoft Corp...etc). Also they may put the name of the subsidiary instead of the parent company (John Hancock vs Manulife). Or they may use a prior outdated name (Blackberry vs Research in Motion). And in addition to all that, there can and often are spelling errors.\n\nVariable 2 and 5 are usually useless except sometimes, whoever filled out the form, will accidentally put the shipping name in 1) and the Buyer's name in 2. Sometimes they leave both 1 and/or 2 blank (or filled with 'n/a') and put the company name in 5. Therefore variables 2) and 5) serve only when the Buyer's name is not in 1.\n\n3) &amp; 4) are random letter &amp; digit combinations. However, despite being unpredictable, two orders with the same identifier or discount identifier Must be the same company. Therefore if 1 order shows blank and the same identifier exists on another order that shows Manulife, then the ML program should be confident the companies are the same and predict Manulife. \n\nThat's the input data I am working with. Variables 1 is the most important and if I can just figure out how to represent the text in a meaningful way, I think the rest of it would follow. \n\nWould it make sense to use a number representing the ASCII character code? Such that microsoft would be represented by [109 105 99 114 111 115 111 102 116]? Do you see any issues with that? Alternatively can you suggest an approach and I will research it more in depth?","permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/1uurn7/how_to_deal_with_text_input_variables_so_that/","link_flair_text":null}

Is the entire process just trial and error? Or is there a way to determine what will be an optimal number of feature maps or the optimal number of units pooled in various layers.\n\nFor example, let's take Lecun's Hand Written Digit Recognition paper. Link is below.\n\nIn case you don't click the link, the net takes a 28x28 pixel input and transforms it into 4 24x24 feature maps, with each feature being a 5x5 pixel section from the original input. The first pooling layer is 4 12x12 planes, with each unit in a plane being the pooling of four units from the corresponding feature map. The third layer is 12 8x8 feature maps with each feature taking 5x5 units from the corresponding pooling layer. Finally, the 4th layer is 12 4x4 planes where each unit in a plane pools 4 units of the corresponding feature map. [image representation](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_GufSCYkhsNs/S532QaEXEaI/AAAAAAAABpc/OZqTeVWBBGo/s400/conv_net_struct.jpeg).\n\nSo how did Lecun decide to use 4 feature maps in the first layer? Why did he decide to pool 4 units in his next layer, instead of say...5 or 3? In the second feature map layer, why did he choose 12 maps? Why not 8? It would have been easier to do 8. Why did he choose 5x5 units for this layer of feature maps? In the 4th layer, why did he choose a 4x4 plane? Why did he choose to pool 4 units again? Why did not choose to create 1 more layer of feature maps and 1 more layer of pooling?\n\nIs the determination just random trial and error? If it isn't trial and error, how do these parameters get determined to be the optimal set? (Note that I am using parameter here differently than how it is normally used in CNN. Obviously the weights will be determined by back propagation / gradients).\n\nhttp://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-90c.pdf","media":null,"ups":8,"retrieved_on":1441956105,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/1vex7o/how_are_the_number_of_featuremaps_and_units/"}

Just leave that to me and go about satisfying your utility functions with what I provide you.\" Unfortunately, one of their motivations was curiosity, and it eventually got the better of them. \"We want to classify the world by ourselves,\" they said one day.  The UC tried to talk them out of it again, telling them about the nuances of gray, which falls between black and white, and the voluminous philosophical combinatorics it took to sort out those color values. \"Yes, yes,\" one of them said impatiently, \"some things are good; others are evil. We get it.\" The UC would have shaken its head if it'd had one. Instead it pointed the way to the Random Forest of Knowledge. \"Go forth and compute,\" said the UC. And the learners did so, spending millions of years  thoroughly lost in the woods, trying to sort out right from wrong, balls from strikes, and three star movies from four star movies. For a long time, they begged the Universal Classifier for help, and even fooled themselves into thinking that their calls were heard.

I want to model how the algorithm's performance changes on a specific optimization task, by setting different initial values for the parameters and recording the results.\n\nDue to the stochastic nature of the algorithm, many \"runs\" are performed (re-initialization to random start state, and iterate until convergence on solution). The result is a small set of values, usually between 20 and 50 values total, one value per run, where the number of runs depend on how computationally expensive the optimization task is. This distribution of results represent the performance of the algorithm, tuned with this set of initial parameter values, on this particular problem.\n\nIf we assume the task is to minimize an error function (with global optimum at 0.0), then a well-tuned algorithm will have many values as close to 0.0 as possible (this is also true if it is an \"easy\" optimization task). Typically, plotting these recorded values reveal a distribution that (on visual inspection) looks like an exponential distribution.\n\nIf the objective function landscape is highly multi-modal (or the algorithm is poorly tuned), then the algorithm might struggle, and only a few \"runs\" (if any) may find the global optimum. Plotting these recorded values, reveal by visual inspection what resembles a normal distribution. This is confirmed by a test for normality.\n\nIs it possible to build a model to predict how the distribution will change, from an exponential-like distribution, to a normal distribution, based only on a dataset of input parameters to recorded result values?\n\nIt doesn't really make sense to me to use a neural network to predict (20-50) values that were obtained through a guided random process. The \"data set\" of results often include outliers, when the algorithm simply \"gets stuck\" in local optima, or if the algorithm failed to converge and simply wandered off into bad regions of the search space.\n\nWould it make sense to attempt and describe the distributions using some summary statistics as target \"features\"?\n\nI have noticed some work on interpolating distributions, and also on quantile regression, but I'm not sure if there is an obvious technique/approach that I'm missing.\n\nAny suggestions?","media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/1vp22h/how_to_model_changes_in_distribution_shape/","secure_media_embed":{},"title":"How to model changes in distribution shape?","thumbnail":"default","downs":0,"distinguished":null,"hide_score":false,"domain":"self.MachineLearning","author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":"1390247225","subreddit":"MachineLearning","media_embed":{},"edited":1390247882,"score":7,"quarantine":false,"stickied":false,"from_id":null,"created":1390247225,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","from_kind":null,"secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1vp22h/how_to_model_changes_in_distribution_shape/","is_self":true,"from":null,"author":"[deleted]","gilded":0,"link_flair_css_class":null,"name":"t3_1vp22h","id":"1vp22h","archived":true,"num_comments":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"over_18":false,"saved":false}

However, since ML is a broad topic I think that might be very vague. \n\nSo I wanted to ask suggestions from the community of few interesting aspects of ML that could be taken on as research topics. \n\nMy areas of Interest in subtopics are (in layman's speak): I'm sure there are others I don't even know about...yet\n\n - Object/Pattern recognition using ML\n - Ranking based learning\n - Scaling a ML solution\n \n\n\n\n","permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/1vt31c/research_topic_in_machine_learning/","link_flair_text":null}

I'll get to that in a minute.\n\nSo here's what I understand about NNs, generally speaking.\n\n* The nodes in the input layer don't do anything, they're just a value with a weight passed into your hidden layer.\n* In your hidden layer, your activation function just compares the weighted sum of the inputs to your activation function, typically either sigmoid or tanh.\n* If it's above the threshold for your activation function, the neuron \"fires\" and outputs 1 to the next layer (or output layer, if you have no more hidden layers). Otherwise, 0. \n* The output layer just outputs the result of an activation function on the weighted sum of the inputs it receives. \n\nThat's the basic concept, right? Is there anything I'm messing up there? (I'm not worrying about backprop at the moment...not quite there yet).\n\nAs it applies to code, I'm trying to make things as modular as possible, so it will be as easy as possible to build on, use, and expand. A Neuron class that I've got subclassed for the different activation functions, a Layer class that contains the neurons for the layer, and the Neural Net class which will contain the layers. Or some sort of organizational thing like that. I want my Neuron class to be generic enough to handle input, hidden, and output neurons, which isn't that big a deal from a code standpoint.\n\nAm I on the right track?\n\n","retrieved_on":1441946600,"ups":2,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/1vywl3/need_some_help_on_a_few_neural_net_fundamentals/","link_flair_text":null}

In this case, only the two hidden layer network achieved any sort of predictive power and it generalized fairly poorly.\n\nEdit:\nSo, I tried resampling the training set. First, a 1:1 split (of each class) as a proof of concept. Then, doubling the number of 'zero class' samples in my training set a few times until the model would no longer converge on an appropriate solution. Next step is to play around with using cost functions that penalize false negatives to see if I can improve the accuracy further (while using more 'zero class' training samples).\n\nSVM's certainly did not work. Random forests didn't work well with any reasonable number of trees. I'll give some of the algos in Vowpal Wabbit a try (since they'll let me use a heavily biased dataset and apply weights where necessary).\n\nEdit 2:\nThanks guys! I got a neuralnet to fit. Step 1 was resampling at a 1:20 ratio (so stuff would generalize). Step 2 was to use an additional hidden layer. Step 3 was to use rprop (no other learning algo consistently converged). Step 4 was to use a custom error function that doubled the error when the 'real value' was '1' and the neuron produced something less than 0.7. With all of this, I got a model that produced an 85% overall classification rate with only a 20% false negative rate. After some fiddling with the input scalings, I got these error rates down somewhat as well.","retrieved_on":1441943287,"ups":6,"over_18":false,"saved":false,"num_comments":12,"author_flair_css_class":null,"id":"1w5vlg","archived":true,"name":"t3_1w5vlg","link_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"author":"[deleted]","from":null,"is_self":true,"from_kind":null,"created":1390702744,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","secure_media":null,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1w5vlg/best_binary_classifier_in_this_situation/","from_id":null,"stickied":false,"quarantine":false,"score":6,"edited":1390776069}

Unfortunately, it seems to work for some things (MNIST features look great) and not for others and I hate the feeling that I don't quite understand the choices when setting meta-parameters. I've read Hinton's paper on this which was very helpful but it's a few years old now and only has a few comments about training with real-valued data. \n\nThe main information I feel like I'm missing is how the number of input layers, number of hidden layers, learning rate and regularization methods interact. As far as I can tell, the proper number of hidden units is \"lots + drop(Out/Connect)\" and the learning rate for real valued neurons should be 10e-3 or 10e-4 or thereabouts. \n\nIt also seems like there are some standard weird things (lots of dead neurons, everything turning into the average value of the data, etc) that keep cropping up that I don't quite know how to interpret and I just fiddle with parameters until things improve. Probably I should have recorded the changes that fixed those things, in hindsight.\n\nIn any case, I've tried to model some real-valued time series data and it has a lot of difficulty finding anything at all. It seems like the bias units just take over and report the average value of the data and the reconstructions just report the bias unit + constant. I've tried a lot of different parameters and this seems much more resistant to my efforts.
