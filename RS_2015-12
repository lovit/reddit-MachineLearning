{"selftext":"I'm a new redditer so I hope I'm consistent with reddiquette...\n\nI'm getting started with Theano and looking for resources I can go to for advice and discussion more detailed than the tutorials.  I don't want to use the mailing list because I feel like I'd probably waste people's time with too many naive questions.\n\nThe issue that started this, is that I'm trying to adapt the deeplearning.net RBM and SdA examples to train on a large high-dimensionality dataset.  Because the data has to be stored as a sparse matrix, when I do is divide it up into chunks of a bunch of multibatches, convert it to dense, and then try to copy it to GPU. \n\nBut, instead of consuming the expected 80% of GPU, its only consuming 3%, and running very, very slowly.

(no code included, but there is a description)","num_comments":1,"selftext":"   For a report (the final, big report we have in our \"big data\" class at my uni), we had to use Hadoop with a machine learning algorithm of our choice (random forest, L-SVM, etc). He had provided code for what he calls \"random forest with hadoop,\" and we were essentially supposed to simply modify this code to run with our dataset, and compare it to a version of the same code that doesn't incorporate Hadoop. \n\n   That being said, he gave us some R code with a mapreduce call in it and said basically, \"here is random forest with Hadoop, compare with a Hadoop-less version.\" Since the class is moreso about Hadoop and HDFS than machine learning, I can't exactly tell whether this code actually does what random forest does. Without posting the code itself (afraid of copyright issues since it's in his textbook), I want to describe what some of this code does. \n\n   Random Forest (mapper):\nThe mapper seems to be creating two bootstrap samples, combining them with rbind(), assigning the bootstrap sample index to the key and the combined samples themselves as the val.\n\n   RF (reducer): The reducer is where the code takes one feature--specified by the coder--and compares each entry in the  feature against the feature mean, assigning a class to that feature (either a 0 or 1 for his example), which I have modified to a feature in question for my dataset, and introduced one more possible class. The original feature values are then replaced with their assigned classes, and... That's it. \n\n   The rest of the code: The rest of the code is mine, and is only for the purpose of debugging: it takes the output, compares those assigned classes against the actual classes, and calculates \"information gain.\" \n\n   The bootstrap samples are never used anywhere else in his code, no bagging is apparent, only one feature is used, and the metric by which that feature is classified is hard-coded and, seemingly, specific to that particular example dataset. No \"trees\" are made, and there is certainly no vote tally function for said trees' outputs. \n\n   The code that performs this function isn't supposed to be some incomplete \"fill-in-the-blanks\" type of situation; rather, it's straight out of a textbook he wrote on the subject that he is using as an example of code for random forest, to help describe how it works. I'm at a loss--I don't understand how this at all accomplishes what random forest is supposed to accomplish, seeing as there is no \"training, validation, and testing\"--the algorithm simply uses mapreduce to compare observation attributes against the feature mean. \n\n   His decision tree example seems to be ridden with manual coder-specified decisions as well, such as a mapper with comments like   \n\"#split needed on left side\"    \n(code)    \n\"#split not needed on the right side\"    \n(code)\n\n   \n   Shouldn't these algorithms be doing that work for me? (Thereby making the algorithms themselves much more complex?) When I use a package like Rpart, it generates a decision tree from my data, with little else to go on that I specify! \n\n   Once again, sorry for my ineptitude, I am not a machine learning programmer, though I *would* like to learn how these approaches work, instead of scratching my head at how a couple of manual comparisons qualify as ML. \n\nTl;dr: My professor gave us code for \"machine learning\" (random forest, decision tree) with hadoop that is suspiciously riddled with manually made decisions about the data/no apparent tree/forest structure (though I am not a machine learning programmer, so my scrutiny is nil).\n\nEdit: tldr, formatting    \nEdit 2: I realized that the bootstrapping code was actually making multiple bootstrap samples, but the code just isn't going any further with them.","domain":"self.MachineLearning","author_flair_text":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","link_flair_css_class":null,"edited":1449111983,"from_id":null,"archived":false,"over_18":false,"author":"wtfisml"}

The mean and variance of the residuals are -0.0019 and 3.535 respectively. The variance seems to be very high compared to what is expected (most texts say the residuals should follow a unit normal distribution).

How do I interpret such an ACF and PACF? I guess the PACF is simple, but the ACF has high values for a large number of lags.\n\n2. How do I select the best model to fit the timeseries? Is there any hope of ARMA (or ARIMA) fitting this series well? Is there anything better?\n\n3. Is the residual variance too high?

The trouble I'm having is with finding the ranges of values (as well as the increments for these values) that I should use for the hyperparameters.\n\nFor example, in the UFLDL tutorial for sparse autoencoders there's rho, lambda, and beta for the major hyperparameters. The values they give for these are 0.01, 0.0001, and 3 respectively. My instinct is to use these as sorts of middle values and take 5 or so values in each direction linearly (i.e. 0.005, 0.006, 0.007, 0.008, 0.009, 0.01, 0.011, 0.012, 0.013, 0.014, and 0.015 for rho) but I know that I shouldn't just use my instinct for this.

My diploma will probably be on generating music using rnn's to give you some background on my interests.\n\nDoes anybody have advice for the top ML programmes in Europe? Ideally, I'd love to go some place where they combine said ML degree with applications in music. What I've found so far is Edinburgh which seems rather interesting. They seem to have done something with deep learning and music before but it might get too expensive.\n\nI've seen QMUL has some music related programmes where ML could be applied, but it's more geared towards music itself + it's in London so extra expensive.\n\nIf I don't take UK into account because of expenses and I also have to take out Switzerland for the same reason. Germany as well, mostly because I don't see myself spending two years there. So what I'm left with is Holland or one of the nordic countries. University of Amsterdam seems to have a relatively good AI programme, but there's nothing related to music around there, KTH in Stockholm seems to also have ML, but with a big emphasis on speech. Aalto seems to also have decent ML, but  again nothing special regarding music. Didn't really see much in Denmark besides a Sound and Music computing programme at Aalborg which has an interesting content but the university itself is pretty poorly rated.\n\nDoes anybody have any experience with any of these? Or just anything ML and/or music in Europe? I'm kinda torn between choosing one, but I'm leaning towards ML. If I do a music one I'd still want to apply ML to what I learn there, but it would improve my DSP background.\n\nP.S. US is ruled out just because of the sheer cost of it, I may consider it for a PhD later, but right now I'm not ready to commit to it.","author_flair_text":null,"link_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","archived":false,"from_id":null,"edited":false,"author":"forloopsarebad","over_18":false,"media":null,"ups":0,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1449354029,"score":0,"saved":false,"name":"t3_3vl9wz","id":"3vl9wz","from":null,"link_flair_text":null,"downs":0,"num_comments":10,"title":"Masters in Europe","subreddit":"MachineLearning"}

The rest of the information you'd use to provide a valuation is in the description, just a big block of non-standardized text.\n\nSo, I'd like to feed that data (price, location, make and model, and description paragraph) into an ANN, and have it pop out the records that seemed to be priced far below average, to help me focus my search.\n\nIs this something TensorFlow would be good at?

Why in back propagation the derivatives end up with the dimension of the variable we're deriving by (like he writes in his example) \ninstead of the way we were taught in calculus class?\nTo derive MM multiplication one needs to treat one of the matrices as a vector, and then the dimensions come out the way i did it.\nI assume this is some sort of optimization technique but I haven't seen any proof of this anywhere.\n\n2. In the case of MM multiplication, how is the derivative in the article like the \"classic calculus\" derivative? Why do they both give the same result? \nAFAIK this is the only way to derive matrix-matrix multiplication: http://www4.ncsu.edu/~pfackler/MatCalc.pdf, \nso deriving WX by X, for example, will give a 15x50 matrix, that becomes 1x50 after chain rule (because we're trying to derive by L).\n\n1x50 doesn't equal 5x10...\n","domain":"self.MachineLearning","author_flair_text":null,"archived":false,"from_id":null,"edited":1449445695,"over_18":false,"author":"lioru","ups":0,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1449443417,"score":0,"saved":false,"media":null,"downs":0,"title":"backprop through matrix-matrix multiplication","num_comments":1,"subreddit":"MachineLearning","name":"t3_3vpv4g","id":"3vpv4g","link_flair_text":null,"from":null}

[this paper](http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/~ajyu/Teaching/Cogs202_sp12/Readings/hinton86.pdf)\n\nWhen implemented correctly, the network learns relationships between people in two isomorphic family trees. The network's inputs are a person and relationship -- e.g., \"Arthur\" \"Father\" and the output is expected to be people that match the relationship e.g.,  \"Christopher\".   \n\nThe paper shows neurons for the person encoding, six for relationship encoding - these are fully connected to a 12 neuron layer - which is in-turn fully connected to a layer with 6 neurons to represent the encoding of the output person, and finally connected to the output layer. \n\nI've attempted to duplicate his network exactly using [Keras](http://keras.io/):    \n\n    graph = Graph()\n\n    graph.add_input(name='person1', input_shape=(X_person1.shape[1],))\n    graph.add_node(Dense(6, activation='sigmoid', init='normal'), name='person1_learned_encoding', input='person1') \n\n    graph.add_input(name='relationship', input_shape=(X_relationship.shape[1],))\n    graph.add_node(Dense(6, activation='sigmoid', init='normal'), name='relationship_learned_encoding', input='relationship')\n\n    graph.add_node(Dense(12, activation='sigmoid', init='normal'), name='predicted_features', inputs=['person1_learned_encoding', 'relationship_learned_encoding'])\n\n    graph.add_node(Dense(6, activation='sigmoid', init='normal'), name='person2_learned_encoding', input='predicted_features') \n\n    graph.add_node(Dense(y_person2.shape[1], activation='softmax', init='normal'), name='person2', input='person2_learned_encoding')\n    graph.add_output(name='output', input='person2')\n\n    graph.compile('sgd', {'output': 'mse'})\n    history = graph.fit({'person1':X_person1, 'relationship':X_relationship, 'output':y_person2}, verbose=0, batch_size=n, validation_split=0.035398, nb_epoch=1500, callbacks=[Peek()])\n\n The Hinton paper was written in 1986, so it predates everything but SGD, which I've used.  Also, like the paper, my implementation uses Sigmoid activation.  I've tried a variety of different initializations.  \n\nHinton's paper he says the network converges within 1500 iterations.  My implementation does not converge at 1500 or, for that matter, 1,500,000.  \n\nHinton's paper shows a visualization, which I've also implemented.  The code and visualizations are available in [this iPython notebook]( http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/dcgrigsby/kinship/blob/master/kinship_net.ipynb).  Looking at the visualizations, I have two competing hypothesis about what's wrong:  (1) it's Vanishing Gradients, (2) I've made a newbie mistake because this is my first Graph network with Keras.  The visualizations make me think I've wired up the network right, but maybe not the inputs or outputs.\n\nI'd be grateful for someone's practiced eyes to take a look.  \n\nThanks.\n\n\n","domain":"self.MachineLearning","author_flair_text":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","link_flair_css_class":null,"edited":1449460889,"from_id":null,"archived":false,"author":"dcgrigsby","over_18":false,"quarantine":false,"thumbnail":"self","from_kind":null,"retrieved_on":1454898931,"author_flair_css_class":null,"is_self":true,"secure_media":null,"media_embed":{},"locked":false,"distinguished":null,"hide_score":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/3vqwl3/hinton_kinship_network_in_keras_doesnt_converge/","secure_media_embed":{},"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/3vqwl3/hinton_kinship_network_in_keras_doesnt_converge/","gilded":0}

I have some difficulty understanding the M2 model proposed in this paper.   \n\nFrom what I understand  they handle the case of labeled data and unlabeled data separately. For labeled data they simply treat it as input to both the encoder and the decoder (along with x and z respectively). The confusion I have is regarding the unlabeled case,specifically:  \n\nIs the label for unlabeled data calculated using a classifier before feeding into the model similar to the labeled case - if so how is the classifier trained since we have so little labeled data ?  And why do they add the classifier loss to the error term separately (eq.9 in paper) ?    \n\nMy understanding is that the unknown y are treated as latent (similar to z) and we hope that q(y|x) will be a good classifier.  But i am not sure if this is enough to train a good model.\n\nThanks for any inputs\n\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","link_flair_css_class":null}

Our working data is generated by a fairly high traffic website in the e-commerce space. I need advice for how to design and spec out a reasonable workflow for our team, specifically around working with a growing image dataset. (Text and structured data we've wranged locally and with spark, it's not the primary pain point right now)\n\nFor our images dataset I bought a single 1TB SSD and packed it chock full with resized images (scaled to 1024x1024). The idea here was to have a local working set we could feed to a local TitanX GPU (what our personal towers are geared with) to train a neural network on a first shot at classification on images. The results were very encouraging, so we want to extend our work in that direction (deep conv nets and relatives)\n\nSadly our 1TB SSD lived too short a life. It was fried before we could train a second net (probably some TRIM issues?)\n\nMy questions for those of you working with image datasets:\n\n+ Do you have RAID setup? SSD? Spinning disk? How many terabytes do you work with?\n\n\nOne of our ops guys (with more expertise on the hardware end of things) outlined the following solutions:\n\nPlatinum Option:\n\n+ $18,000 crazy beefy shared work station\n+ 12 cores, 128 GB, one or multiple GPUs\n+ 10 TB of storage in RAID6\n\nGold Option:\n\n+ 16 cores 2.6GHz\n+ 64GB DDR4\n+ 10TB of Storage in RAID6\n\nBronze Option:\n\n+ $2000 for 2 Samsung 850 Pro 2.5, this is 1TB in RAID1 attached to one of our current workstations, it will then become more of a shared workstation when working with the larger datasets.\n\nHere's how I see things evolving:\n\n+ I think it would be most convenient if we're able to play with a large subset of our images locally. We have decent memory on our local stations, and beefy cards as well, so really we're just underprovisioned on storage at the moment.\n\n+ So going with Bronze, we're able to meet above and bring solutions to the prototype stage. We would then need to work on scaling training to a more massive dataset, say using multiple GPUs on one machine, or across machines.\n++ I do think we need to go by baby steps here though. I think that we should prove our prototypes locally first, and in the next step tackle the scaling beyond a single node. This is part of why the Bronze option is appealing.\n\n+ Should we go with the SAN setup and bring the whole shebang locally?\n\n+ Should we forget about training on our towers and move to AWS's seemingly wimpy GPUs?\n++ My only holdback against this is the iteration cycle. Locally, our Data Scientists are able to iterate quickly on developing a method. The AWS move feels like jumping to solve the scalability problem before we're proven our methods.\n\ntl/dr: any and all comments around your multiterabyte workflow are appreciated.

I'm trying to use a LSTM net to model the XML-based project files for some software, with the aim of generating new ones. The project files have a very specific structure and a clear beginning and end (the &lt;root&gt; and &lt;/root&gt; tags), so the so-called 'sequence length' should be the whole project file right? I have hundreds of these files, so should I treat them individually as training examples with variable sequence length? If so, then clearly I can't fit that all into memory since the files contain up to 1000000 elements. Internet seems to suggest truncating the backpropagation. Since I'm using lasagne, does that mean setting the gradient_steps argument to something reasonable? \n\nOr the other way is to concatenate all of them into a single mega long file and go through bit by bit. But this doesn't make sense because each file is a distinct unit that doesn't 'wrap around' like that.\n\n\nAny help would be so much appreciated.

Presence of metastasis in lymph nodes of cancer patients is a poor prognostic sign and prompts for more intense treatment. Automated detection of metastases is highly meaningful and holds a great promise to improve the diagnostic process.\n\nWe are providing two large datasets (400 whole slide microscopic images of size 218,000 * 95,000 pixels) from the Radboud University Medical Center (Nijmegen, the Netherlands), as well as the University Medical Center Utrecht (Utrecht, the Netherlands). This will be the first challenge using whole-slide images in histopathology giving the participants huge amounts of data to train their systems. To see an example image with annotated tumor region have a look at the link below:\n\n[Data description](http://camelyon16.grand-challenge.org/data/)\n\nPlease check out our website for further information about this challenge.\n\n[camelyon16.grand-challenge.org](http://camelyon16.grand-challenge.org/)"}

Lots of great talks, lots of good food (catered!), lots of people. **Lots** of people. Almost 4000.\n\nThere were four poster sessions, each with 100 posters. If you're reading this subreddit, you can do the math in your head. If you can picture what happens when you combine math and rugby, you have a good approximation of the NIPS poster sessions.\n\nDid I mention that conference attendance is growing exponentially? The organizers made sure to point this out in the opening session. Next year, there will likely be 5000 or 6000 people. Making the problem worse: the number of papers is only growing by 10% year-over-year.\n\nThe issue is simple: **Modern conference-based poster sessions don't scale.**\n\nDeep learning is a hot topic, the attention it's getting will not diminish any time soon, and the solution I heard multiple people floating at the conference was, \"Let's cap attendance next year.\" And that's a terrible solution. We have an amazing field that's making revolutionary leaps and bounds, and rather than finding a scalable process for knowledge dissemination, we're thinking of limiting it?\n\nThe only (obvious) solution I can think of is to have modern math papers come with a 4-6 minute video of a \"poster presentation\" where the motivation, analysis/methodology/algorithm, and results are laid out. Doing so would facilitate much faster transmission of results across a much larger swath of the math community. It would also allow the NIPS organizers to avoid having to find helmets for people for next year. It would also bring math into the 21st century, where I can find any manner of how-to information on YouTube, but no descriptions of recently published math results.\n\nI'd like to know from the people here who were at NIPS this year (or similarly large conferences, like ICML) what your feelings were on the poster sessions and whether you think videotaped poster sessions (or anything similar) sound reasonable. They could always have actual poster sessions as well, but allowing attendees to focus on Q&amp;A rather than dissemination of technique and results might be really useful.\n\n**tl;dr** The NIPS poster sessions this year were 70% math and 30% rugby, and we should try to find a long-term solution for the problem of efficient knowledge dissemination at large mathematics conferences.","author_flair_text":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","link_flair_css_class":null,"from_id":null,"edited":false,"archived":false,"author":"thatguydr","over_18":false,"quarantine":false,"thumbnail":"self","from_kind":null,"retrieved_on":1454925371,"author_flair_css_class":null,"is_self":true,"secure_media":null,"media_embed":{},"locked":false,"distinguished":null,"hide_score":false,"secure_media_embed":{},"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/3wn1z8/nips_2015_or_how_modern_conference_poster/","permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/3wn1z8/nips_2015_or_how_modern_conference_poster/","gilded":0}

It can take the left or right path at each node OR it can traverse both paths with a higher cost (lets say speed decrease or something). If it reaches a leaf which is not the goal state, it can traverse back up from where it came and chose another path. I would like to create some algorithm that maps out a possible behavioral pattern given certain search strategies (like is it better to traverse left and right with the added cost or chose one path over the other.

In the paper above, they discuss that orthogonal initialization is not as [kurtotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurtosis) when dealing with multiple layers.\n\nMy main question is: What is the verdict on this? Do you guys go with orthogonal most of the time? \n\nIf anyone wants to shed light on why orthogonal weights are so powerful, please do so. I'm still struggling to understand why they lead to improvements. ","author_flair_text":null}

Those unfortunately are huge lists and each text is a huge commitment of time. So I'd like some opinions on what I should prioritize to read next.\n\n* I will be picking two texts, one more practical and one more theoretical. Alternating between the two daily to mix things up. Otherwise, I'd only focus on practical stuff since my current job is in applications in industry.\n* My related course background: I took an undergraduate course in statistics (using Part I and II of Wasserman's All of Statistics), a graduate pattern recognition course (using Duda et al.'s Pattern Classification), and a graduate machine learning course (no text, selection of papers).\n* Beyond that I did read Casella &amp; Berger's Statistical Inference (the one and only book in Jordan's list I can check off!) and Bishop's Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning. Using Bishop as the reference, my knowledge is mostly in the first half of the book (linear, basic ANNs, SVM) and the second half of the book I'm less familiar with (graphical models). I recall trying to read Robert's Bayesian Choice some years ago and it was beyond my level for the most part. Not sure if I could read it now, since I've sold it before my last move.\n* My current reading is reviewing Wasserman's All of Statistics (Part I and II) and I'm about a third through Shalev-Shwartz &amp; Ben-David's Understanding Machine Learning. I'm enjoying the latter quite a bit since I glossed over the learning theory in school and so the perspective in this text is refreshing.\n* For my next \"practical\" text, I'm kind of settling down on Aggarwal's Data Mining. Covers a wide range of topics I'm not familiar with (association, outlier, network analysis, etc.) that I need would be good to have in my toolbox. But I'm welcome to other suggestions.\n* For my next \"theory\" text, I'm less certain. Should I dive into one of Jordan's suggested statistics books (probably Lehmann's Elements of Large Sample Theory is the reasonable one for my level) or should I start his sequence of probability texts (starting with Grimmett &amp; Stirzaker's Probability and Random Processes) to build up to measure theoretic probability because that will make the statistics texts more understandable? Or should I follow Cross's suggestions and maybe read some linear models text (e.g. Faraway's Linear Models with R), robust statistics (e.g. Huber &amp; Ronchetti's Robust Statistics), or Bayesian statistics (e.g. Gelman et al.'s Bayesian Data Analysis)? Sooo many choices.\n\nMaybe in 10 years I could get through Jordan's and Cross's lists haha","domain":"self.MachineLearning","author_flair_text":null,"downs":0,"subreddit":"MachineLearning","title":"Which machine learning and statistics (or related) books should I read next?","num_comments":9,"id":"3wqsnu","name":"t3_3wqsnu","preview":{"images":[{"variants":{},"resolutions":[{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/jVGoplaJWaqrde_yIm6_5Wczr6xcj1wINq5j9tPDea0.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=39ad60f3aaa0200d69ef149df660e72a","height":70,"width":108},{"width":216,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/jVGoplaJWaqrde_yIm6_5Wczr6xcj1wINq5j9tPDea0.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=e4cee324fbaefaadf896eeee3f218e48","height":140},{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/jVGoplaJWaqrde_yIm6_5Wczr6xcj1wINq5j9tPDea0.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=a07cc71eec88bc3d63567b317c8bdc55","height":208,"width":320},{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/jVGoplaJWaqrde_yIm6_5Wczr6xcj1wINq5j9tPDea0.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;s=3388196bf73500a6b8b2147a19fc2e92","height":416,"width":640},{"width":960,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/jVGoplaJWaqrde_yIm6_5Wczr6xcj1wINq5j9tPDea0.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=960&amp;s=ccc62b10ff538b5ea0845ec4dd30be7b","height":624},{"width":1080,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/jVGoplaJWaqrde_yIm6_5Wczr6xcj1wINq5j9tPDea0.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=1080&amp;s=8b2224ba36ac9ed1559add7ac2a8555b","height":702}],"source":{"height":1041,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/jVGoplaJWaqrde_yIm6_5Wczr6xcj1wINq5j9tPDea0.jpg?s=12cc08fe6137f71c3e8880bb1223729e","width":1600},"id":"T6svqoNdKFIt4jvCkwz2FVwZMDMaFR592TwYpUNyBCg"}]},"from":null,"link_flair_text":null,"stickied":false,"ups":14,"saved":false,"score":14,"created_utc":1450068610,"media":null}

{"author_flair_text":null,"selftext":"I am quite new to the machine learning field. The only experience I have is the machine learning course offered by Andrew Ng on Coursera. I am interested in applying what I learned from that class to my research. \nMy research deals with using a set of meteorological variables\n(such as wind speed, temperature, humidity, etc) to predict the day when extreme precipitation will occur. Here is my problem set:\n\nfor example, I have daily observations of meteorological variables and corresponding extreme precipitation dates and non-extreme dates from 1979-2014. I also have modeled daily data of meteorological variables from 1979-2005. My purpose is to build a binary classification model (extreme versus non-extreme) based on observations, then apply the classification model to the climate model data. Not only I want to see if the constructed model works for the climate model data, but also I want to compare how model performs compared with the observations.\n\nHere are my questions:\n\n1. Suppose I have to do some-processing to the observation data, for example, normalization by subtracting mean and dividing with standard deviation, then divide the data of 1979-2014 into training data and test data.  There are two ways: 1)  Normalize the entire time series (1979-2014) first, then divide into training data (1979-2005) and test data (2006-2014). In this way, all the time series use the same mean and standard deviation to normalize; 2) Divide the the data into training data (1979-2005) and test data (2006-2014) first, then normalize each data set separately. In this way, two data sets use their own mean and standard deviation. Which is the normal way in terms of machine learning? If I use the first way to normalize the data, when I apply the constructed classification model to the model data which spans from 1979-2005, is there any inconsistency issue since I have to normalize the climate model data based on its 1979-2005 mean and standard deviation. I mean \u201cconsistency\u201d mostly because I want to compare performance of applying the classification model for the climate model data with the performance of the observations (training data results).\n\n2. Since each meteorological variable in my case is a spatial field (x-y dimension), and what I am dealing with is an unbalanced classification (few\nextreme dates, but much more non-extreme dates). What I did is not to construct a linear or non-linear regression model, but to perform the Fourier transform for each day of a particular meteorological field first to reduce the data dimensionality. I extracted the phases at 20 center locations for each extreme and non-extreme date, and then build 1-D and 2-D empirical distributions for each center location using all the extreme and non-extreme dates, respectively. Next, for each day at each center location, I calculate the log-likelihood ratio of its phase belonging to extreme and non-extreme empirical distribution and sum all the ratios across the center locations. Then I construct two ratio distributions: one based on all extreme dates and the other based on all non-extreme dates. The decision threshold for extreme and non-extreme can then be decided based on the two ratio distributions. Currently I tested this method using the second way to normalize the data. But I found that the method works really well for the observational training data set (1979-2005) with very good accuracy, precision and recall, but works really poor for the observational test data (2006-2014). I assume this could be related to the overfitting problem. But I am not sure how to correct such problem with my method as I cannot simply apply regularization as normally done in linear regression.  So any\nsuggestion on solve the overfitting problem in my problem set would be highly appreciated.","domain":"self.MachineLearning","link_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","over_18":false,"author":"saguaro648","archived":false,"edited":false,"from_id":null,"media":null,"score":0,"saved":false,"created_utc":1450189842,"ups":0,"stickied":false,"from":null,"link_flair_text":null,"name":"t3_3wxy32","id":"3wxy32","num_comments":2,"title":"Seek advice/suggestions for applying machine-learning in my research","subreddit":"MachineLearning","downs":0,"media_embed":{},"distinguished":null,"locked":false,"gilded":0,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/3wxy32/seek_advicesuggestions_for_applying/","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/3wxy32/seek_advicesuggestions_for_applying/","hide_score":false,"secure_media_embed":{},"thumbnail":"self","quarantine":false,"retrieved_on":1454930593,"author_flair_css_class":null,"from_kind":null,"secure_media":null,"is_self":true}

Is this perhaps something natively available rather than explicitly defined, or is it that libraries like Keras and Lasagne don't support this kind of network? \n\nAppreciate any information on developing a solution that can handle this, and I am particularly interested in libraries that have built in functionality for algorithms like ML-BP [[1]] (http://cs.nju.edu.cn/zhouzh/zhouzh.files/publication/tkde06a.pdf)  and a cross-entropy with AdaGrad [[2]] (http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-662-44851-9_28#page-1) type solution.\n\n[[1]] (http://cs.nju.edu.cn/zhouzh/zhouzh.files/publication/tkde06a.pdf) Multi-Label Neural Networks with Applications to Functional Genomics and Text Categorization\n\n[[2]] (http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-662-44851-9_28#page-1) Large-Scale Multi-label Text Classification \u2014\nRevisiting Neural Networks","author_flair_text":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","link_flair_css_class":null,"edited":1450226365,"from_id":null,"archived":false,"over_18":false,"author":"eygrr","media":null,"stickied":false,"ups":4,"created_utc":1450226000,"score":4,"saved":false,"id":"3x0j5w","preview":{"images":[{"resolutions":[{"width":108,"height":81,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/gP9fXfE6gf8yJ3kat2JzT0_Y3kek8Cqj3GiO0xL1kJ4.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=572062d853f91b48cf3268547df09f8a"},{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/gP9fXfE6gf8yJ3kat2JzT0_Y3kek8Cqj3GiO0xL1kJ4.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=191689522124f003d3add08b52c1cd4d","height":162,"width":216},{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/gP9fXfE6gf8yJ3kat2JzT0_Y3kek8Cqj3GiO0xL1kJ4.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=b36786d2a6e9743846666e3f19ff4f30","height":240,"width":320},{"width":640,"height":480,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/gP9fXfE6gf8yJ3kat2JzT0_Y3kek8Cqj3GiO0xL1kJ4.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;s=a1a63ef9a5a185f0a4f5cced78fd8248"}],"source":{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/gP9fXfE6gf8yJ3kat2JzT0_Y3kek8Cqj3GiO0xL1kJ4.jpg?s=bf065811b5be9febb5575e4478466c40","height":600,"width":800},"variants":{},"id":"w-gH_HMEEUS6FHsnYJLk65KlKLuNhFYRWVcWQjQpYus"}]},"name":"t3_3x0j5w","link_flair_text":null,"from":null,"downs":0,"subreddit":"MachineLearning","num_comments":12,"title":"What libraries are available for Multi-Label classification using Neural Networks?"}

{"edited":1450403085,"from_id":null,"archived":false,"author":"ThatWillNeverShake","over_18":false,"selftext":"----\n*Disclaimer: This is not meant as a political analysis or opinion*\n\nBased on Andrej Karpathy's [article](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) on text generation, I built a model for text generation in Keras. However, instead of using character-level input data, I instead use words Donald Trump uses in his speeches as the input, and feed it to an Embedding layer. His speeches contain ~50k words with a vocabulary of ~3k words. I picked Trump because the transcripts for his speeches are more readily available, and more organic because they are not scripted (to the best of my knowledge). However, because his speeches are stream of consciousness, he tends to repeat phrases over and over again, which sometimes cause the model to get stuck in a loop when generating them, although I'm not sure that's 100% correct.\n\nNonetheless, I was able to get Donald Trump's speech transcripts since the beginning of his campaign from [what the folly](http://www.whatthefolly.com/). And I think the model is able to generate speeches that have...uh...Trumpian flavors?\n\nFor example:\nWith feed of \"mexico and iran are\" the model generates:\n&gt; taking over the next day, he doesn't win, he doesn't win, he doesn't win, he doesn't win, he doesn't win, he doesn't win, he doesn't win, he didn't know. i said, what's wrong? the art of the deal. they did not read that i spend less. and i have to tell you. i have a friend, bill zanker, who's a very smart guy. he said, if you don't have great people. we have a lot of big news conference. and let's talk about it. and you know, i was the king. i was the ultimate. i think the deal is done, a lot of the pundits on television, as usual, saying that should you know, i was a little weak on, people were interviewed. believe me, i was the blonde. i say, that's a hundred percent. but you know, they say, although,, you have to go out, we have to go to japan. did you hear this? iran. they let her out. he gave them $150 billion. it's called amateur night, we had a situation in california very recently where somebody said, \"you shouldn't probably against as the one. she was a horrible negotiator. these people are babies. they're babies. do you remember when they said they want to impeach, do you remember, no, they're wrong. very stupid people. and every country in the world, i mean, i think. but i listened to them today. some politicians, but you know, i was in manassas, virginia, wherever i mean, look at this. somebody said, do you have thin skin when i'm right. we can make this country great again. the ladies and gentlemen. i am officially going to happen. that i can tell you that. i'll bring back our jobs from china, from mexico, from japan, from so they standpoint of spending more money on from the country. i think he'd be to be at $20 trillion. according to the economists, because i'm totally against the trade bill doral, we had a situation in california very recently where somebody said, \"you shouldn't you're not protect. what are we doing? and you know she's been going on. corporate million. it's a great assets. and they said i was the only one that's self funding. i don't want it. so we take it down. so they are going to take it down. so they are going to take it down. they couldn't believe it. i believe it. i believe in \n\nand with feed of \"I love America because\", the model generate:\n&gt; we have a $2 trillion. we have nothing. and every time we have to help those people, we have to straighten out, we have to be strong, we have to go to japan. did you hear this? iran. they want to work. they can't. they don't have to develop, i can tell you. i will immediately terminate president are leaving our country. and then we have to get the greatest people that are sitting back like in the can give him millions. he has $2 million sitting in a super pac. i want to see christmas. no, i want to see christmas. no, i want to see him by himself. he's a bad negotiator. he's actually in a race. it wasn't just casual, it could be, but i doubt it. he knew about it. they didn't mention at $250 million you right? so we decapitate one. them trump is calling for a total and complete victory. gen. douglas dollars. i've turned down so much money. i have a friend, bill zanker, who's a very smart guy. he said, if you don't have great people. we have a lot of foolish people. we have great people. we have to be strong. we have to get strong, and we have to do something to clean up this country. so i ordered 4000. that's the difference between china's leaders and hell what they're doing. we have a lot of foolish people. we have a 24 day period, not a bad story. i won't say that. so, if you have some dumb office on television, as usual, saying that who is getting the oil, most of the oil? the stuff. it's natural. it's a great poll. it's true. it's true. it's true. they'll pay me anything. they have nothing. don't worry about it. but obama is talking about the ukraine. i think that's terrible. does anyone know this is a great audience. but i have more, i won't use the candidates' name because i don't want to run. they never thought of him as this as the people that are running that super pac there, they'd go to the chinese, a lot of the pundits on television, as usual, saying that who should get the oil, and what they don't do that. so, if you have some dumb office. i'm building as you know, afghanistan for $43 million, can you imagine this is a great poll. it's true. it's true. it's true. it's true. it's true.\n\nBut more interestingly, because I use embedding layer, each word is represented as a vector. So if I feed it to a clustering algorithm (I used KNN), [this](http://pastebin.com/k16wqVuF) is what came out. Although most of the clusters are useless, there are clusters with clear subject (e.g. the words \"is\", \"that's\", \"it's\", \"be\", \"was\", \"are\", \"by\", \"they're\", \"we're\", \"only\", \"what's\", \"i'm\", \"you're\", \"wasn't\", \"family\", \"negotiate\", \"nobody's\", \"everyone's\", \"she's\", \"funding's\", \"neighbor\", \"something's\", \"damn\", \"understandhe's\", \"everything's\", and \"i'm\" all belong to the same cluster). \n\n*edit:\nAfter some fine tuning I was able to make the speech a little bit more coherent.\nWith the seed \"make the country\", it outputs\n&gt;rich. it was terrible. but saudi arabia, they make a billion dollars a day. i was the king. i was the king. i was the smartest person in yemen, we have to get to business. i have to say, but he was an early starter. and we have to get to business. i have to say, donald, i can't believe it. it's so important. but this is what they're saying, dad, you're going to be really pro, growth, blah, blah. it's disgusting what's disgusting., and it was a 19 set washer and to go to japan. did you hear that character. we are going to have to think about it. but you know, i've been nice to me. something happens in washington. the beauty of washington. not a good deal. we have to get to business. but i've always said qatar so what i do well. i think we're going to get it back. no, it's true. you know, it's about time that on iraq. he couldn't answer the question, is iraq. think of it. trillion. trillion dollars to the horrible thing he just said, \"oh, give you an example. and they say, \"we beat china\"? you know, people say that's such a hard time even though you know i'm going to do it. remember the poll numbers are horrible. i mean, i can tell you is going to be really pro, growth, seven, 000 people. it was terrible. but saudi arabia, they make a billion dollars a day. i was the smartest person in yemen, we have to get to business. but i've always said qatar so what i do is i build a great wall. and it's got to stop and it's got to stop and it's got to stop and it's got to stop and it's got to stop and it's got to stop and it's got to stop and it's got to stop and it's got to stop and it's got to stop it. and we have to get through these 15 people to another country. and believe me, to the women, it's all about jobs. we have to get to business. i have to tell you, i love people. but i know how to go about making the deal. all of my life. like this. and it's very unfair. i feel it's very sad. now we owe $19 trillion. the budget is so bad. the imbalance is what he should. and you know, we had a really good.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that Trump's speech can be pretty incoherent at times because he would jump from one topic to another abruptly.","domain":"self.MachineLearning","author_flair_text":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","link_flair_css_class":null,"id":"3x3een","preview":{"images":[{"id":"JiGPgaHX71ivSm17nn1b-3z3BBQtBEUm4A3c1ID8dNw","source":{"width":1639,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/bQadO_ovZDNTBdcbqmX3WZQFUj4Vc-rPVVGGu5Zd_sE.jpg?s=3885dc0fd461f7ee6768ea39c36d9b8f","height":825},"resolutions":[{"width":108,"height":54,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/bQadO_ovZDNTBdcbqmX3WZQFUj4Vc-rPVVGGu5Zd_sE.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=9c08da67ef30380b8b582ab366d18cd3"},{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/bQadO_ovZDNTBdcbqmX3WZQFUj4Vc-rPVVGGu5Zd_sE.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=ae0bdf6891d71bd404614b2c28d9a7c9","height":108,"width":216},{"height":161,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/bQadO_ovZDNTBdcbqmX3WZQFUj4Vc-rPVVGGu5Zd_sE.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=e31d1a855a398eb8245e6b538e60f91b","width":320},{"width":640,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/bQadO_ovZDNTBdcbqmX3WZQFUj4Vc-rPVVGGu5Zd_sE.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;s=c562630fb581236f9378b11b64680e5f","height":322},{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/bQadO_ovZDNTBdcbqmX3WZQFUj4Vc-rPVVGGu5Zd_sE.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=960&amp;s=ce9ca2aae351210aaa0075d6ed99bc18","height":483,"width":960},{"height":543,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/bQadO_ovZDNTBdcbqmX3WZQFUj4Vc-rPVVGGu5Zd_sE.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=1080&amp;s=2f1ac1470d6323a4e78474d1be7d193c","width":1080}],"variants":{}}]},"name":"t3_3x3een","from":null,"link_flair_text":null,"downs":0,"subreddit":"MachineLearning","title":"Robo-Trump: Generating Donald Trump Speeches with Dictionary Embedding and LSTM, and Words Clustering","num_comments":10,"media":null,"stickied":false,"ups":15,"score":15,"created_utc":1450282985,"saved":false,"secure_media_embed":{},"hide_score":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/3x3een/robotrump_generating_donald_trump_speeches_with/","permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/3x3een/robotrump_generating_donald_trump_speeches_with/","gilded":0,"media_embed":{},"locked":false,"distinguished":null,"post_hint":"self","is_self":true,"secure_media":null,"quarantine":false,"thumbnail":"self","from_kind":null,"retrieved_on":1454933137,"author_flair_css_class":null}

Here is a video that really simplifies neural nets and explains the intuition behind this method.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2HPcj8lRJE","domain":"self.MachineLearning","subreddit":"MachineLearning","title":"Deep Learning SIMPLIFIED: Episode 2 - What is a neural network?","num_comments":2,"downs":0,"link_flair_text":null,"from":null,"id":"3x97ew","preview":{"images":[{"variants":{},"resolutions":[{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/MyBeJPVqUH0XKGWZEbqi58VczM0l0TS9ms7kj4FyEDw.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=2f9eb7b0503272f825fe09a447d7fafd","height":81,"width":108},{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/MyBeJPVqUH0XKGWZEbqi58VczM0l0TS9ms7kj4FyEDw.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=22e68f9cfd82620566a54016c1736513","height":162,"width":216},{"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/MyBeJPVqUH0XKGWZEbqi58VczM0l0TS9ms7kj4FyEDw.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=453cc1fd0188dbf2d4003969766fae00","height":240,"width":320}],"source":{"width":480,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/MyBeJPVqUH0XKGWZEbqi58VczM0l0TS9ms7kj4FyEDw.jpg?s=1b9a6382274e2e3d96f055f328165f1e","height":360},"id":"it_RGRaVIvH0xvZI6uVHFQMeEQmnCrvAy0fvgWgIAFw"}]},"name":"t3_3x97ew","saved":false,"created_utc":1450382684,"score":10,"stickied":false,"ups":10,"media":null,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/3x97ew/deep_learning_simplified_episode_2_what_is_a/","gilded":0,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/3x97ew/deep_learning_simplified_episode_2_what_is_a/","secure_media_embed":{},"hide_score":false,"locked":false,"distinguished":null,"media_embed":{},"secure_media":null,"post_hint":"self","is_self":true,"retrieved_on":1454935917,"author_flair_css_class":null,"from_kind":null,"thumbnail":"self","quarantine":false}

But why did I do this.","num_comments":1,"downs":0,"author_flair_text":null,"selftext":"Hi,\nSo I started writing yet another tool for autodiff, which is based on symbolic backward autodifferentiation. Currently it lacks any documentations at all. However it pretty much resembles almost identically Theano. Why did I do this:\n\n1. I wanted automatic shape inference at compile time. This is achieved by using the fact that we know that all shapes of the graph are a polynomial over the integers of the inputs. Requires a bit more verbosity on specifying \"dynamic\" shapes if they are the same. However, this means that any shape mistake will be inferred before the graph is compiled. As a consequence of this Broadcasting is an explicit operation (similar to CGT). However, there are flags on the graph which for some operations you can let it do it automatically without complaining (implicit broadcasting)\n\n2. For Recurrent models if you do not have a scan(which I currently don't and don't know if I will, but probably should) graphs can get very large and Theano compilation time is slow. That's why I think the optimization procedures should be done more efficient and would be the main effort on my side of tool. \n\n3. Most important for me! The fact that the graph manipulation and source code generation should be 2 separate things. I wanted to make something that other people can reuse, so my main goal is to make it fully just a graph autodiff. Soon I will add something like \"backends\" which would generate source code based on the graph. Potentially, I will have and something like \"execution graph\" which to sort of assign variables to each node (e.g. for memory to be able to reuse memory) and inlining of different operations. My first look is to do it with Arrayfire (https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire) as it does all of the lowlevel stuff with very little programming effort and works on both CPU and GPU. \n\n4. For later I think maybe people who can optimize more can do their own backends of how to generate the source code, while the graph part to remain the same so it is easily reusable. Also in much further future maybe doing distributed stuff would be helpfull as well or multi devices, however that is further down the path.\n\nThe repo is here:https://github.com/Botev/metadiff.\nAny criticism and comments are most welcome.

In this video, the motivation behind using deep neural networks is explained in detail.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEv_0r5huTY","author_flair_text":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","link_flair_css_class":null,"id":"3xdzui","name":"t3_3xdzui","preview":{"images":[{"id":"aLkZAZiZ2Kvq4VWPXPoh4MqcyOSayHwIuE7h-K8Ajhg","variants":{},"source":{"width":480,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/QfWOwhiR_nGDZ4wJq3C_DG0X9HXQEIpoV7pg12PTXI0.jpg?s=d7962d5dffb4c28c7f978cbb779d5338","height":360},"resolutions":[{"width":108,"height":81,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/QfWOwhiR_nGDZ4wJq3C_DG0X9HXQEIpoV7pg12PTXI0.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=b2344f61a668692249a9d25e31ccd217"},{"height":162,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/QfWOwhiR_nGDZ4wJq3C_DG0X9HXQEIpoV7pg12PTXI0.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=056c62c8e9085731f7a6d74e8de4284a","width":216},{"width":320,"height":240,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/QfWOwhiR_nGDZ4wJq3C_DG0X9HXQEIpoV7pg12PTXI0.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=94cf3dc83aec2dff784ddb907ec90bf0"}]}]},"from":null,"link_flair_text":null,"downs":0,"subreddit":"MachineLearning","title":"Deep Learning SIMPLIFIED: Episode 3 - Why Deep?","num_comments":8,"media":null,"stickied":false,"ups":16,"saved":false,"created_utc":1450471575,"score":16}

I have a stronger programming background that stats students (strong Python, low-intermediate C/C++, Unix, etc.) and ML background (took grad classes in the CS department that involved good measure of implementation and theory) but no CS fundamentals (algorithms &amp; data structures, software design). \nI'm afraid that most ML engineer interviews will involve an equal measure of ML/statistics questions and generic algorithm theory questions.\n\nIs it the case that you basically need at least an undergrad CS degree level of CS before getting a job in ML?","domain":"self.MachineLearning","subreddit":"MachineLearning","title":"Machine learning Engineer vs Data Scientist","num_comments":18,"downs":0,"from":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"3xfxy5","name":"t3_3xfxy5","created_utc":1450508990,"saved":false,"score":19,"stickied":false,"ups":19,"media":null}

Then a 16 layer Denoising Autoencoder is trained with ELU activation followed by dropout layers for the encoder and linear activation for the decoder layers. I then add 2 LSTM layers in between the last encoder and first decoder (i.e. the deepest layer in the autoencoder). Each Autoencoder layer reduces the dimension by 250. I then train the LSTM model with overlapping encoded data. Unsurprisingly the LSTM layers add a lot more capacity into the autoencoder. \n\nTo generate the model that will create new data, I feed the encoded data output from last encoder layer (i.e. before LSTM layers) onto layers of LSTM's, and then top it off with the LSTM layers from the autoencoder with frozen weights (i.e. untrainable). Instead of shifted blocks of input like I did [last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/3td04a/music_generation_using_stacked_denoising/), I instead train it with the shifted blocks of the output of the autoencoder after the LSTM layers.\n\nI use 2 methods of generation: appended parts and whole generation. Appended parts appends the last block of each predictions into the results, while whole generation just use the whole output as the next input.\n\nPart Generated:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMD04EPm0mU\n\nWhole Generated:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0ZdSAkGo48\n\nI also tried different generation sequence length for comparison (listen with headphones):\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dwfxuLGsPA\n\nThe whole generated sounds closer to the source material, but I'm not sure if it's overfitting the model or what. There is no clicking noise anymore like I did last time because now it's properly windowed.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\nedit: [github](https://github.com/ppramesi/JOANNA)","author_flair_text":null,"is_self":true,"post_hint":"self","secure_media":null,"from_kind":null,"retrieved_on":1454940093,"author_flair_css_class":null,"quarantine":false,"thumbnail":"self","hide_score":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/3xi096/screwing_around_with_models_music_generation/","secure_media_embed":{},"gilded":0,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/3xi096/screwing_around_with_models_music_generation/","distinguished":null,"locked":false,"media_embed":{}}

When did you first bump into the band? When was your first meeting with the band? all the repetitive questions)  I believe that the state-of-the-art text processing technique has reached the level to build a system that process text in a collaborative way. I think this kind of service is very imperative because it is nearly impossible to answer the millions of questions rushing through thread but it would be more efficient to answer the question that has been mostly questioned about.\n\nIf you guys know any similar research or corporation which is working on the similar problem, I'll be glad to see sharing them with people here.","over_18":false,"author":"inctrljinee","archived":false,"edited":false,"from_id":null}

My initial guess would be to adjust the learning rate, but I thought I tried that already.

The photos can be any size, and the logo could be varying sizes and also distorted (imagine if the logo is on a surface at an angle, or on the side of a curved bottle).\nI am thinking that maybe this could be handled with neural networks. I've followed some of Andrew Ng's lecture notes and they sound very powerful, however I am struggling to understand how NNs can handle the target image located in a different part of the main image, or distorted in some way.\n\nIt's easy for me to understand if the input image and the image you're trying to recognise are the same size: every pixel maps to a weight, over several layers, that eventually lead to a similarity metric between two images.\nHowever how can this approach cope with the translations and resizings that I mentioned?\n\nI'm looking at a Java library called Neuroph, which sounds interesting. Basically I'd like to hear from anyone who solved a similar problem before, what ML approach you would recommend. I've also collected some sample photos with logos in photos of varying quality which I could use as training data. However I'm unsure what to do next.\n\nAlso if neural networks really are the best or most practical way of solving this? For example, are they slow or do they use a lot of memory? What about a cascade classifier?\n\nAny advice welcome, especially if you've had experience with a particular approach.\nthanks a lot!","link_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","over_18":false,"author":"niujin","archived":false,"edited":1450888546,"from_id":null,"thumbnail":"self","quarantine":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"retrieved_on":1454948247,"from_kind":null,"secure_media":null,"is_self":true,"media_embed":{},"distinguished":null,"locked":false,"gilded":0,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/3xz10c/logo_detection_in_photos_distorted_and_resized/","hide_score":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/3xz10c/logo_detection_in_photos_distorted_and_resized/","secure_media_embed":{}}

I'm not sure how i would handle this with sequences and it sounds like a lot of one-on-one case based scripting would be necessary to get it to work the way i want.\n\nAnother way i imagine it to work would be to \"bind\" the progress logic directly to the network output which could then control it.\n\nAfter reading a bit this sounds like it could use reinforcement learning, letting the system control the output and rewarding/penalizing it based on the correctness of the action it takes.\n\nAny thoughts on that?

If the number of training examples is low it is better to use a SVM or decision trees.\n\nBut what is huge? what is low?

I am calculating the gradient numerically at each point. \n\nPlease let me know if this is not the right sub.","domain":"self.MachineLearning","author_flair_text":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","link_flair_css_class":null,"post_hint":"self","is_self":true,"secure_media":null,"quarantine":false,"thumbnail":"self","from_kind":null,"retrieved_on":1454953184,"author_flair_css_class":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/3y9gkj/how_can_i_avoid_oscillations_in_gradient_descent/","hide_score":false,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/3y9gkj/how_can_i_avoid_oscillations_in_gradient_descent/","gilded":0,"media_embed":{},"locked":false,"distinguished":null}

For example, while English speakers will say: \"The boy is ON the bus\", French speakers will say: ``Le garcon est DANS le bus\" (Literally, \"The boy is IN the bus\"). Similarly, English speakers will say: \"The picture is ON the wall\" while French Speakers will say \"Le tableau est AU mur\" (Literally, \"The picture is AT the wall\"). The purpose of this project is to use statistical techniques and Reference tools such as Dictionnaries, Thesauri, or WordNet to browse through large corpora of bilingual texts and attempt to learn translation rules that will associate the correct French translation to the English locative preposition used in a given context. \n\nSince this project can be managed in two phases (a French and an English phase) separately, although preferable, knowledge of both English and French is not required. After learning the various text processing tools, the student will be given the freedom to choose the direction for his/her project that interests him/her most.

It says the network \"shares weights across the source and target dimensions.\"  But properly two of the three dimensions follow the target sentence -- I'm guessing the third dimension which the paper refers to as the \"hierarchy\" is not sharing weights with the other two, but I'd love to get confirmation on this.  Also, do I understand correctly that there's a softmax output with loss+supervision only on every other layer of the hierarchy -- the ones that are scanning the source sentence backwards?\n\nAlso, in the parity experiment (5.1) what does it mean to have a 1-LSTM with tied weights?  With only a single dimension, if the weights aren't tied, then it's not even an RNN any more, right?  Which would open up all sorts of ambiguity in the other experiments about what \"untied\" means.  I'm assuming that within a single dimension the weights are always shared, so I'm confused why it even says \"tied\" for a 1-LSTM.  I think that terminology is included to reinforce the similarity with the tied ReLU/tanh networks, but it's confusing.\n\nThis seems like important work, presenting a general framework for multi-dimensional networks that  perform quite well on a wide variety of tasks.  But IMHO it could use some cleanup to make it easier to understand.

There are often subtitles in various languages which provides a nice translation dataset (more relevant for many contexts that e.g. EU documents).  One can also use the fact that the sound and video are synced with the text to do multi-modal unsupervised training (e.g. train embeddings that map simultanuous image/audo/text data into vectors that are nearby).  There's a lot one can imagine doing with this.  Has anyone tried?  Are there datasets available?\n\nThe second thing is even more puzzling.  I don't know where to get them but I imagine there must be giant troves of reading comprehension questions from middle or elementary schoolers.  These can either be standardized tests with answers or even just graded questions.  They can be multiple choice or even freeform graded text.

If it is done in convLayer1 the bottleneck would lose 75% of the information already computed in the image as it has 1x1 filter_size.\n\nWhat is your intuition from reading the article?","domain":"self.MachineLearning","subreddit_id":"t5_2r3gv","link_flair_css_class":null,"secure_media":null,"is_self":true,"thumbnail":"self","quarantine":false,"retrieved_on":1454964087,"author_flair_css_class":null,"from_kind":null,"permalink":"/r/MachineLearning/comments/3ywi6x/deep_residual_learning_the_bottleneck/","gilded":0,"hide_score":false,"secure_media_embed":{},"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/3ywi6x/deep_residual_learning_the_bottleneck/","media_embed":{},"locked":false,"distinguished":null}
